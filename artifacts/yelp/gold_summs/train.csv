business	1zYltl3s23LN7lxdqM5qmg	They mess up your order and make you wait 15 min literally I'm not over exaggerating 15 min then when you go into get your money back mind you I didn't ask to keep the food I just wanted my money they don't refund save yourself the money don't go to this KFC.	We had takeout from KFC tonight. Horrible - chicken greasy and cold. For what you pay it is a rip off! The original recipe use to be good - what happened - Colonel Sanders must be rolling over in his grave.	Usually they screw up the order and then give attitude when you ask them to fix it. We are in the building right now and it's cooler outside, no A / C, freakin hot. Don't seem like they care, not site we'll be back to this one	Zero star all the way. I don't like kfc anymore and went vegetarian after going to this chain. Chicken doesn't taste as good like 20 or so years ago, the management doesn't believe in good quality and even good service. I rather go to Popeyes and not waste my money to this chain.	We have been moving all week and the KFC was right bear the new house do we thought sure it would be easy and good. Boy were we wrong. The food was terrible. My green beans were sour rotten and my sons strips tasted like they had a chemical in them. Not good. Very disappointing	Stop. Just go to Frys and purchase their chicken. You are making a mistake eating here. This location is super slow. Never trust a restaurant that cannot turn over food via consumption quickly. Last amount of advice... go elsewhere.	Over priced chicken that is just ok I remember when the cornel owned KFC back in the late 50s and 60s it was so much better than now. The chicken pieces look like they came from a pigeon they were so small! Go to Albertsons about a mile away 8 large pieces $6.99	Stop by for a chicken little. Boy was it little. More like a very expensive bun with mayo. No quality controls, the cook couldn't even fix it correctly. Probably a one off, but definitely not up to any standards.	The chicken is terrible and so is the rest of the food. The servings are also incredibly small. The food is not worth the money. Also, the cooks are slow so expect to wait a long time on line. The manager does nothing to resolve these issues.	Horrible experience, the chicken was cold, greasy and so small, like they are from a pigeon. . It's not in anyway up to standard. The food was horrible. The  green beans were rotten, sour and the strips tasted like there was chemical in them, very disappointing. The management does not believe in good quality and service.	This formerly great chicken chain restaurant has gone sharply downhill. Their recipe has changed for the worse, resulting in overpriced chicken that is greasy and tastes like chemicals. On top of that, portion sizes are small, wait times are long and the customer service is unfulfilling. Overall, the price-value ratio is very low, so this restaurant is not recommended.
business	24YIAXzArY1w2GXzoUbcmw	First time here and was very pleasantly surprised. Lo mein & shrimp pad Thai were delicious. Not overly saucy, salty, or greasy like some Chinese can be. Very fresh ingredients. Friendly & fast service & prices are great!	This place was super quick to have our order ready for carry out and was pretty tasty, especially for the great price! I didn't particularly love how many veggies were thrown in with their Beijing beef (it was almost hard to find the bits of beef in the mixture), but the beef itself was very flavorful and I LOVED their potstickers!	I went to this place when it was still Feedbag and then turned into Wok In. I'm generous with the ratings, because the price is very good, the staff is friendly and attentive, and they have the best Vietnamese fresh spring roll. Just love it!! That, and also spicy long beans with shrimp (and / or tofu).	We were Antique shopping and Yelp'd this location, so we decided to try it out. We will definitely be back! The prices were very inexpensive and the meals were delicious. We had Spring Rolls, Pot Stickers, Orange Chicken and the Pho. Everything was delicious!	For $5 an entree this place can't be beat. Good food, friendly and fast service. I had the spicy Thai noodles and they're just as good as anything you'd pay for at another competing restaurant. Great place for a cheap, friendly, low pressure meal of good quality	We decided to give this place a try based on prior reviews. The first thing we noticed upon arrival in the parking lot was a horrible smell of rotten food coming from the dumpster area. Prices are low and the staff is pleasant. The menu is limited. Crab angels were well flavored but cold. Orange chicken was overpoweringly citrusy. Vegetable lomein was unremarkable.	My husband and I love this place! We especially love to come when we are super hungry because there's never a wait! The service is great and the food comes out very fast. We always get the pho and love it!	Talk about a restaurant that has quality fresh food at a fantastic price! I have been here twice and would highly recommend it! The restaurant is clean and the staff provide superior customer service! A wonderful environment for a couple or even a family. I will be visiting again when I'm back in the Mesa area! Thank you for such a wonderful experience!	This restaurant provides average quality food at very low prices.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is always friendly. The service is reliable and the food comes out fast as there is rarely a crowd.	This place offers incredibly low priced food for the quality they provide. Service is friendly and also very fast to get the food out.  Food is good, especially considering the price, in particular the spring rolls and pot stickers are recommended. Overall this place is highly recommended.	Good restaurant with good food at very affordable prices. Nice place for couples or families. Staff is efficient and friendly and provides great customer service. Environment is just average. Overall good price/value ratio hence recommended.
business	2P7PjL-tJAtMtWSz6VN_Pg	Bowling is great here but the best part is the Bar the last 2 years Garret always remembers us. He takes great care of all customers makes us laugh. It's great to have someone who knows what he is doing. Thank you Garret for making us want to come back even if we aren't bowling.	Great bowling alley located at Orleans casino. Been dozens of times, always happy. Everything you'd hope for a bowling alley. Clean, nice staff, open 24 hours, good prices, snack bar, nice lounge with drinks, several bathrooms that are usually clean, lockers to use. Good times. I'll be back.	Lots of lanes. Clean. Easy to access bar, and tables and slots downstairs in case you're still fighting the urge to gamble a little. This place rocks! And it's a great step away from the regular lounges and nightclubs. $1 games on week nights from midnight-6am. With $3 shoe rentals. Including Sundays.	We came origianally for the buffet and realized that the casino had a bowling alley. We decided to take our 3 kids upstairs and do some bowling. It was $26 for 4 of us for one game (residents get a little discount when you show ID). It was pretty clean and we really liked it. Will be visiting again for some more fun	This is probably one of the biggest bowling alleys that I've ever bowled at and I absolutely love that it's 24 hours! The service is very fast and there's hardly ever a wait. Thumbs up to the alley, the food and the workers as well!	For a bowling alley it's pretty much perfect. After midnight it's only $1 a game, although shoes were fairly expensive at around $5 (can't remember exactly). A decent amount of drink specials along with no real complaints make this place probably the best bowling alley I've been to in Vegas.	A clean bowling alley with lots of lanes. Stay in the hotel and receive a 2 for 1 game coupon. It's a nice option to have when you've lost all your money downstairs or need a break from all the winning you're doing. There's also a small arcade attached and a snack bar for your noshing pleasure.	$1 bowling at midnight can't go wrong also a lot of lanes. Also if you wanna take a break from bowling and not go down stair to the casino u can get a beer for a $1 at the bar. If ur a bad bowler like me blame it on the beer.	This is a great bowling alley. There are a lot of lanes, and it is clean. It is open 24 hours, and after midnight games are only $1 each. The snack and drink bar has a lot of specials, as well. This bowling alley is highly recommended for those that are tired of gambling in the casino below.	Great place, great services. Customers are always satisfied with the bowling alley which is one of the best. The bar is also topnotch and offer great customer service, and age verification.	This bowling alley is clean and offers tons of lanes. There are always game coupons floating around and after midnight games are $1 a piece, making it a super budget-friendly venue. Shoes are a bit expensive to rent though. It's open 24 hours, too. In addition to the bowling alley, there's a small casino downstairs and an attached arcade. The venue also offers a snack bar, lockers, clean restrooms, and a small bar with beer and minimal alcohol options.
business	3BWt6MX0KicK5YgV_6iJYg	Coffee is usually good, today they had to finish brewing the decaf. I waited and what did I end up with, a cup full of coffee grounds. Had to spit out most of the cup of coffee.Guess I need to bring my own filter when I visit this Starbucks. Very disappointed.	I just went thru the drive thru, and the coffee was extremely cold. The guy at the window didn't seem to be coherent! I am paying $7 for a cold cup of coffee?? This isn't the first time my coffee is cold.	This location has pretty much gone down hill through the years in terms of service. The baristas seem like they don't want to be there and who ever is stationed at the register in the morning acts like its a burden that you're ordering coffee so early. Weird.	I come here everyday. The baristas are all very friendly and always recognize us when we walk in. The manager John is very nice. They always have our mobile orders ready when we walk in. Never had an issue here. Will continue to come back!	Great place to stop by first thing in the morning. There's an Asian chick that works there who's the bomb! It's nice to have someone recognize you and start making your drink as soon as you walk through the front door! Definitely one of my favorite spots.	Terrible service! I came in to get iced coffee.. Sat outside and came back for my refill and they said 'no.. Can't do it if you leave the store!' Wow... I love Starbucks and never had an issue like this before. Not ever coming back to this location ever!!!!	Worst cappuccino ever. Burnt flavor and they made it twice. Way to throw $4 down the toilet. If they can't train people to do it right then don't waste your time. McDonald's coffee is better then this.	Excellent coffee and seating areas. I like it when seating areas take up more space than stupid retail. Who's thinking of buying an espresso machine early in the morning. Let me drink my coffee and hop on the wifi. I'm here every week so, no complaints and my order is always exactly how I like it.	This Starbucks location is overall not well recommended. While regulars seem to get good service and like the coffee, overall the service seems to be not very good, with baristas who are sometimes indifferent or incompetent. The coffee is pretty expensive, and sometimes is served cold, burned or otherwise not done well. Most will find better coffee elsewhere.	The place used to be good, but now they have bad customer service and not so great coffee. Customers are getting cold and burnt coffee.	This is a great place to stop by in the morning. Services are top notch. Baristas are friendly, they take orders and start making drink as soon as possible. The seating areas are great and the coffee is excellent.
business	3CG7oBD_k85M8jJ_JlhL-A	Just OK in my book. I've had better burgers in Charlotte. The sweet potato fries were very good. The regular fries were fine - but the portion was pretty small. The service was efficient - no complaints.Never been there in the past, so I don't have an opinion on the old management / new management debate.	A quick, simple math equation to describe my feelings toward the Penguin: Pixies + Frank Sinatra + cheap, delicious burgers = my kinda placeI'd even say it's a good alternative for a weekend spot, as it's open late, has a full bar and just a fun atomosphere.	The Penguin has the best burgers in town! I usually get mine 'southern style'. It's a small place, so there's usually a wait. But, I don't mind waiting because the food is soo good! They have a nice bar selection as well. It's also in a cool, eclectic area in Charlotte.	First of all, burgers have buns, not toasted white bread. 2 out of 4 orders were wrong toppings. No refills on drinks, never once asked how the food was, and it took 45 minutes to get us 4 orders. What the hell has this place become?	The food is really really good and is not very expensive. I love hush puppies and they were probably the best I have ever had. The burgers and sandwiches are all really good and the service is fantastic. The only problem is that the place is small and the wait is usually long.	Used to love this place but it has gone to s * * t. The food isn't the same and neither is the atmosphere. My friend got food poisoning from a chicken sandwich he ate here and it messed him up for three days. Save your self a bad meal and walk around the corner. Its no longer the charlotte staple it once was	Any place that serves Corn Dogs and Banana Pudding is always a winner for me. Has one of the best Juke Boxes in the city. I have never had a bad experience here. Watch out for Friday and Saturday evenings because it gets busy fast.	The burger was really good and the fried pickles were awsome. Although the wait staff was very friendly, we waited a really long time for our food! Looked like there were alot of other people waiting too. If the food had come in a more timely manner I would have said 5 stars.	The restaurant has recently gotten new management, which may or may not change the restaurant's character. The food is generally well-liked. The atmosphere is unique. The main issue is that it is small, therefore wait times are long. It is recommended if the wait time is not an issue.	Gets busy and is small, so waiting is common, especially on weekends. Food isn't the best, but the burgers are decent and the prices are low. Portions aren't large but there is a good bar selection and the atmosphere can be jumpy with the juke box going.	Enjoyed the cleanliness of this place. The staff was very nice and professional. Burgers were nice but nothing to write home about. It can get busy quick so expect long wait times. The beer selection and bar are top notch. Overall, a great concept with a local flare.
business	3JTGnElYrZvul4Q-aUIx9Q	Decent food - my daughter had the Avocado Toast and I had the Frittata Rustica - both top notch. Downside was the terrible coffee (so weak) and the annoyingly loud music being piped into the speaker directly above our table. Would come back for the food, but next time grab a coffee for the Starbucks a couple of doors down	NOT dog friendly! Just opened, absolutely no other customers, but wouldn't let me be at an outside, sidewalk table with my 4lb purse pup. The tables are on a public sidewalk of a strip center. If you have a dog, go to the Hilton, right next door. They sat me at a lovely table near the pool.	Great healthy food and even better service. I was in town for the weekend and LOVED this place. I liked it so much that I ordered a sandwich and salad to go for my lunch. The pic is my breakfast of protein packed mini pancakes with almond butter. Yum yum yummmm	1st time here today for a breakfast meeting. I ordered the power bowl. When the waiter brought out our food me messed my order up. He quickly apologized and ran my correct order out FAST. Upon getting the bill he comp'd my whole meal! Wow i was so surprised and he went above and beyond! The quinoa bowl was amazing also!	Went here for breakfast. Had the American breakfast. It was good. Turkey sausage was good. Someone got the pancake and it was huge. They said it was good. Someone else got the waffle, said it was good. Someone also got the avocado toast and said it was really good. Service was great.	Came here for a business breakfast. Nice, open environment with fast, friendly service. I ordered the Farmhouse Skillet and it was delicious. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but will definitely stop in if in the area and would have other business meetings here.	Great food! So healthy they have choices of all sausage which I love! I had the breakfast tacos and banana granola pancakes so amazing! I would definitely return to try more on the menu! Wanted to try everything!! My boyfriend got a morning juice and he loved it! Felt so cleansed. Staff was nice and gave you your space!	Ask for Carlos. He was awesome. The pumpkin pancakes were terrific. I had had a bad experience last time and I told Carlos and he made it great. And did I mention the pumpkin pancakes? I almost didn't come back but so glad I did.	They offer a variety of great foods on their menu. They focus on breakfast, sausage and a variety of flavorful pancakes are among their top hits, but also offer foods for other times of the day.  Some of their waitstaff can be a bit lacking at times and make mistakes, but they will go out of their way to correct things to please the customer if mistakes are brought to their attention. They are also a good location to hold business meetings.  Overall this restaurant is highly recommended.	Although this is not specifically a breakfast restaurant, it is the meal most catered to and the time the venue is busiest. The pumpkin pancakes, avocado toast, and turkey sausage are all exceptional. There are a variety of salads and sandwiches for lunch, too. The staff is friendly and attentive without being intrusive. On the downside, the coffee is surprisingly bad, especially for being a venue that caters to breakfast. Also, there are some outdoor tables available, but they aren't dog-friendly.	A great place for delicious and healthy food and remarkably excellent service in terms of speed and courtesy. Worthy of mention are the generous pancakes and a comprehensive menu of sausages. Dogs might be a bit of an issue, though. Nice place, recommended for breakfast.
business	4LPrdCK0L7GFF6vLP5cGTw	Food was average however, I felt it was super overpriced and small portions. I got a regular size and a large size and they are in the same containers with the same portions. I got double protein and it didn't even seem like it. Would not return.	The freshest, tastiest, and healthiest salads, sushi, vegetable bowls, and soups I've tasted. Did I mention their wide selection of teas and other refreshing drinks? The restaurant is clean, bright, and well managed by cordial staff headed by always cheerful manager Louis. I highly recommend Tokyo Joe's!	First time here and I was super happy about the food. Everything tastes fresh. The only thing I would have liked to seen more of is the chicken that goes in the 'make it yourself bowl'. Next time I'll just order extra chicken to it. Other than that I will be definitely coming back!	Discovered this extraordinary sushi gem while on a business trip to Phoeni. Albeit hidden near Nordstrom s Rack yet well worth the hint. Friendly staff. High quality sushi. Reasonable serving sizes. Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed. Enjoy.	Food-born illness? Gee, thanks so much. Just want I wanted. As if hearing the chef (and also possibly manager?) talk down to his employees right in front of customers repeatedly wasn't enough to make me uncomfortable as a patron, imagine how I'm feeling hunched over my toilet here at 5: 00 am right now.	The poke bowls are great! I get the grilled shrimp over mixed greens with mango, edamame and avocado. Hawaiian dressing. Garnished with sushi ginger, red pepper flakes and green onions. Easy to get to, solid service, great iced tea. It's a lunchtime staple	Ate here tonight at 7 and the girl making sushi was great with helping me out. There was a mix up with the rolls ordered and she corrected my roll right away and got my roomie his correct roll also. She knows amazing customer service! Sad I didn't get her name.	Ramen soup had no flavor, noodles were not ramen but overcooked spaghetti, barely any bean sprouts and too many watercress... could of spent a lot less if I cooked my own ramen at home.... unfortunately will not be back to give other dishes a try.	This sushi restaurant serves high quality sushi and poke bowls, though their other dishes can be hit or miss. The staff are friendly and experienced. The serving sizes vary by dish, but are generally considered to be reasonable for the cost.	This is a fine Asian restaurant. Sushi is fresh. The poke bowl is personalized and there are plenty of options to combine to make it. The staff is hospitable and quick to help the customer. The food can sometimes be less than stellar. Overall, the restaurant is very well recommended.	The food can be a tad pricey but is usually worth the cost. Wide variety of menu items with great food quality. The staff does a great job and management is always helpful, though can be rude to employees sometimes.Overall, it can be expensive but is highly recommended for it's delicious food.
business	4jWZByIPL_S-UFczMuD3yw	Cutest bakery around Tempe area. Food was awesome. We had the loaded waffles and bacon & blue galette. Warm atmosphere. A few tables inside and out. Chess board to play while you drink coffee or eat. Definitely coming back.	I've only been once and had a delicious little tart! The crust tasted like it'd been frozen, which is a pet-peeve for me, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. Service was also very personable. I'll definitely be back!	Stopped in today to pick up some bakery items for one of my clients. The owners of the bakery are very accommodating and very friendly. The cinnamon roll I had was fantastic I will be back. Our little bakery gem in Tempe	Yes--the sandwich was yummy for my tummy!! I ordered the shredded chicken sandwich with sweetest season chips and iced chai latte for lunch. It was all most. I had this delivered to my house cause I worked from home and this was the best lunch ever.	I love this little bakery in Tempe! Fantastic breakfast menu and I can't wait to go back for lunch! I love their savory pastries! Also their chocolate espresso cake is unbelievably fantastic... with a cup of coffee... heavenly!!!	They just upped the prices on the loaded waffles from I believe $7 to $9.50. Disappointed in the price jump I liked that it was a fast place to get a good waffle but at that price I might as well save my self for a sit down restaurant. It was good but sorry to say I won't be visiting any longer...	I'm so happy I found this place. Amazing is an understatement. The food is really good, the pastries are even better, and the staff is incredibly nice and helpful.The egg, cheese, and bacon sandwich with waffle bread is my favorite. I really like the cream puff and bread pudding too. Pretty sure I've tried everything and it is all good	Love love love their pastries. Everything we have bought so far from here has. Even delicious. From huge chocolate covered strawberries to the most delicate cheese danish I've ever had. Oh and a yummy salty focaccia bread. Location is great and shop is cute. Definitely a place to check out.	This bakery is well-known for its excellent pastries, sandwiches and desserts. The staff is very friendly, accommodating and personable. It has a nice atmosphere, and though it is primarily a takeout shop, there are a few indoor and outdoor tables available. This bakery is highly recommended.	The bakery is welcoming and the owner and staff are attentive and friendly.  There are tables inside and outside, and a chess board is available to play, too. The pastries are the main attraction here. They are delicious, but they are pricey. The waffles are good, but the portion is underwhelming for the cost. It's well worth a visit.	The staff is what makes this place, they are always so warm, welcoming and extremely knowledgeable. Beautiful and mouthwatering pastries, and they even serve breakfast and lunch! Definitely the go-to bakery for orders large and small orders. The atmosphere is friendly and the shop is very cute!
business	4lKF-M_3OLsk1usLPDJEFA	Have been here multiple times in hopes they get better but they don't. 3 out of 3 times messed my order up. Unfortunately they are closest Einstein's to me so in stuck. I have been to others and they are much faster and don't tend to mess up orders quite like this location.	I love to eat here! I get lunch here a lot. I like their chicken salad sandwiches and asiago cheese bagels with garden veggie cream cheese. They should keep it opened an hour longer, though. I know bakeries are all into fresh foods, but it closes before most get to eat dinner.	Nothing too spectacular - just another bagel place. I got the good grains bagel w / honey almond cream cheese (yummy) while others in my group got: the pizza bagel, thin bagel sandwiches, jalapeno w / plain cream cheese, spinach florentine, and some holiday one that was super sweet.Price wasn't anything too expensive.	Surprisingly good breakfast thin asparagus mushroom and egg white. Wraps not so much. Asiago toasted with veggie always decent. However please get a better system in place because I've never been able to get out of there in less than 15 min for a bagel!	The best Einstein location in Summerlin. Always in and out with ease and professionalism from the staff. I usually go on Mondays as they have a dozen bagels for $7! I have never ordered a specialty bagel sandwich but I would recommended for any bagel lover who wants a bulk deal.	I grab a cup from these guys every morning at this location. Great, friendly serviceThey have the best coffee, fresh, strong never burned. Jeanie is the one you want to help you when your there. She makes you feel at home.	This place is neat and clean and they have really good bagels. I also appreciate that they have a soda machine, given that I don't drink coffee. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I think it's extra nice that they will bring food to your table, even if it is merely a toasted bagel with cream cheese.	Waited like 20 minutes for a dozen bagels. Finally got home and the box with the bagels opened up from the bottom and all the bagels fell onto the driveway. Brought them back and was reluctantly given a refund and the doofus manager still tried to charge me for the cream cheese even though I had know bagels. Definitely won't be going back!	This place specializes in its bagels, the asiago cheese bagel being one of their top requests.  They are a good place to get bagels in bulk on the go. They also offer sandwiches, wraps, and coffee, but those aren't what they're primarily known for. Overall this is a solid place to grab a quick breakfast in the morning, or food on the go.	The bagels are really good, and the price isn't too expensive. The staff is generally friendly, helpful and professional, although the wait time can be as high as 15 to 20 minutes.	A great place for bagel lovers, remarkably affordable and decent in quality. Time management and order processing seem to fall a little below par, but the staff is friendly and helpful. Clean environment and overall recommended place.
business	5COCKqGYvt-Cf81GtL53XQ	Best breakfast in Akron. They care about quality and it shows in the food. The bar is designed like an island in your kitchen, makes you feel like you're at home. Wait staff is very professional and treat you like family. Owner is local and is very hands on; which shows in the food. Great place for lunch too!	Very busy on weekends, yet there is never too long of a wait. Service is great and the portions are very generous, especially the pancakes! (My favorite). The new interior is very nice and adds great atmosphere!	What a great place! Food is amazing and it's not just your ordinary breakfast or lunch spot. The food is unique and delicious. One of my favorite is the red eye hash! Fresh orange juice or a bloody mary, either way both delicious. The service is always great and the atmosphere is good.	One of our favorite breakfast spots. There's often a wait on the weekends but we've never waited more than 10 minutes. The host and wait staff and always friendly and accommodating and the food is consistently wonderful. I recommend the eggs Benedict with crabmeat or the red eye hash!	Great restaurant. More thank likely you'll find a wait, but it's worth it. Breakfast is amazing no matter what you get. If you get a lunch try the fries, double fried, dipped in white French dressing. Or order it as a side. You'll thank me later.	Fantastic Omlets wonderful friendly service. Killer spicy Brown potatoes and the special crooked river jams. One of my top breakfast stops. Relaxing with a cup of coffee and surfing the web. great way to start the day. And they have great sandwiches too for lunch.	A very good breakfast spot that has it's own take on popular dishes. The potatoes are especially tasty, though everyone at our table enjoyed their meals which ranged from pancakes, eggs and french toast. I also like the Akron themed pictures on the wall.	Great breakfast!!! Come early because lines start early. Bloody Mary's and mimosas. Fast and affordable. Great experience. Staff was friendly and the portions are huge!!! $- $$. Great price and an amazing brunch stop in Akron / Fairlawn my eggs and sausage were cooked perfectly!!!	This restaurant has consistently good food and service. It is an especially popular place for breakfast, though they serve a tasty lunch as well. The atmosphere inside is positive and the staff are always friendly. Expect a short wait on the weekends, as it can become overcrowded.	Really great restaurant for a nice breakfast! Fantastic and unique dishes that never fails to amaze customers, friendly and efficient staff, generous portions and great atmosphere. Excellent menu with a wide variety. Management is quality-minded. Overall a highly recommended place.	This restaurant is often very busy on weekends, but even so there usually isn't much of a wait. The staff is very friendly and provide great service.  The food is a bit unique, but all of it is very good,  particularly the eggs and pancakes.  They specialize in breakfast, but also offer sandwiches for lunch.  The portions are large for the price they charge. This place is highly recommended.
business	5fE9BDxFj66rhbnJ8PmZZw	Visited this location on Friday Aug 3 2018As usual it was a busy Friday happy hour, however our waitress Jocelyn was fabulous. Not only was she pleasant, and attentive, she offered fabulous options for wine. Good help is hard to find, don't loose this girl!	Food is expected and average. But the Tuna Stack and Calamari are above average. It's the corporate industry types' flavour du jour and how can you blame them. The food is decent, the service is never sub-par, and the ambience is quite attractive.	There is only one vegan option on the menu (unmarked), but it was pretty good. About 4 stars.The beer choices are limited and the descriptions misleading. Minus 1 / 2 a star for that.The service was definitely 5-star. I was amazed at how friendly they were are how deftly they handled the difficult diners in our group. Huzzah!	My server is a cow - period - this sucks when we get the pretentious one - I am not familiar with the night servers as I take clients here during the day - she is not going to serve me again - Chloe - sorry 'babe' as you call us - not good enough	The hostesses are so rude! I don't mind waiting for the lounge when it's busy but don't be rude about it and when I ask if I can order a drink while I wait.. they walk away and ignore us. I enjoy going to the Barlow location. Not Stephen Ave.	Wonderful restaurant with great atmosphere. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu items. I had the salmon and my husband had a steak. Both entrees were prepared to perfection. We will definitely return next time we are in Calgary.	My boyfriend and I came here for happy hour. Although the food wasn't all that amazing, the patio is gold! The cocktails + this patio = love. It's such a wonderful spot to just people watch and hangout especially at lunch on a workday or during happy hour as you can see the people hustling and bustling around town.	Our waitress was extremely kind. Our group had to go to this place last minute on a very busy night and they found a way to accommodate 9 of us. Very happy with the speed and quality of service as well. Will be coming back and bringing friends	The restaurant has some servers that are fantastic, but there are also some rude servers and hostesses working here.  Service is quite speedy and remarkable. The seafood and steak are well above average.  The atmosphere and ambience are quite wonderful and make people feel comfortable while they hang out and people watch.	Good restaurant in a nice location. Atmosphere is great and it features a nice patio for hanging out. Food is decent and menu is limited for vegans. Staff is nice and accommodating but customer service can be a hit and miss. Overall recommended place.	The night waitresses are friendly and attentive, but the day servers and waitresses can be rude and ignore customers. Happy hour, though busy, is the best time to go to the restaurant. The food is is good and the ambience of the restaurant, thanks to view from the patio, is wonderful.
business	6rYnfSWSkyXnlD3Fjep3PQ	Yum! That frosted cinnamon roll and endless cup of coffee we enjoyed was de-licious! The wait staff was friendly, and the atmosphere open and cheerful. The three salads we ordered to go were each fresh and delicious. My sassy cousin and I will return!	New location, but same great food! Food is always fresh and the staff is always friendly. Best cinnamon roles around. Period. I refuse to eat anyone else's cinnamon roles. Give this place a try for breakfast, lunch or to cater your next event or party. You won't be disappointed.	My daughter and I are in Scottsdale for a meeting when we decided to try Sassy's. It was fantastic! The portions are really big. But the salad and sandwich was great. We decided to try the cupcakes and they are just as amazing!	Wanted to grab some cupcakes for a family members birthday and noticed that Sassy's had a little more variety than other places around. They did not disappoint. Stopped in for the cupcakes, stayed for bacon, eggs and toast (with purchased cupcakes awaiting me in the cooler) They were a big hit!	Just started eating here a few weeks ago and it's amazing. I work close by and so I have had lunch there 4 times and each time the food is delicious. Order on the phone a head of time make it even easier to pick up and eat lunch on my break. My favorite sandwich is the Sassy Club!	Why have I not heard of this place before? I had breakfast. It was filling and yummy the tea was good. I souls try the coffee next time. Oh yes. I will be back. Clean place. Decorated well. Do wish there was pricing on the desserts in the cases I hated to ask on each thing. Overall great experience.	This is the second winter my wife and I have been in the Mesa area. Sassy's in one of our favorites. We love the cinnamon roll french toast! If you want your sweet fix, that's the stuff to get. Staff very friendly and helpful. Oh yea, great freshly baked bakery treats!	Shabby Chic meets the dining room. Think of a poor man's Sweet Cakes Cafe... complete with the sandwiches, cookies, and the scores of women gathering for the lunch and the latest gossip. Sandwiches above average but man those cookies are something special. My dentist thanks you.	Its shabby chic meets a high-end bakery that happens to serve amazing food. The service is always top notch, the staff is knowledgeable with every item on the menu and in the bakery case. They are invested in putting out a quality product every time and its always an amazing experience here including the wide variety of teas and coffees.	Sassy's is a favorite spot for local workers taking a lunch break. It has large portion sizes, and good variety. Some of the best items to have for lunch are sandwiches, coffee and cinnamon rolls for breakfast, and cupcakes for dessert. The staff are friendly and helpful, and the atmosphere is clean and open.	This is a remarkably good cafe, with friendly staff. Their cinnamon rolls, sandwiches, cupcakes and coffee are especially great. They offer quite a wide variety of sandwiches. Very warm and cheerful atmosphere, overall a highly recommended place.
business	7os-CT7QI8P_sy1QKwhzjg	They changed owners and its under new management!!! They have all new servers and they are very sweet and friendly. Food is still amazing, great price on drinks! If you haven't tried it in the past two months you need to!!;)	1st And last time here. Parking lot seemed packed which led me to believe that it was a good place to eat. 47 minutes later still sitting here waiting for food. Waitress has to many tables and hasn't been back by to check on us.	OMG.... new management! Slow as S * * * service... they don't have a system in place to wait on customers... its more like they have a system in place to ignore customers. Not much was right, especially the price....	This restaurant is horrible.. 3 times I've tried this awful place! If you actually get sat then pack your patience for chips and salsa much less a drink.. the food is sub par. The service is slow and terrible.. I will never waste my time with this place ever again!	Under new management!!! Finally! Food is still great and service is now up to par. Katharine was an awesome waitress- friendly informative. For all you folks that stopped coming cause of bad service (like us) - give it another shot!	I ordered the arroz con pollo and I'm pretty sure it wasn't just chicken but pork mixed in as well. I had my dining companion taste the dish and she agreed. I'm not into mystery meats so I'm solid hell no on the food here.If you go maybe get something like shrimp. It's easier to identify.	I found a rock in my food. It was the size of a pinto bean and was mixed in with the rice and beans. Thank goodness I did not break a tooth! I am very disappointed and no longer trust eating here.	We've been to La Fiesta Grande twice in the last two weeks. Both times the food was good and the service was very reasonable. I was hesitant to try this place based on some of the other reviews but our experience was very positive. We'll definitely be back.	The new management has a lot to learn. Without a system for seating tables the wait can be long. The service can be really good or mediocre depending on the night and the waitress. The overall food quality has gone down tremendously, even the free chips that take a while to get.	This place is under new management, which has helped with food and service consistency, but it's still not perfect. The servers are generally sweet and friendly, but the restaurant seems to be understaffed sometimes, so when it's busy, service definitely suffers and it takes a long time to receive orders. The prices are fair, especially on drinks. The food can be good, but a stone was mixed in with the pinto beans once, so the beans likely weren't rinsed well before cooking. The chips and salsa are great.	This place is under new management.  The service is good in that the staff are generally friendly albeit somewhat slow.  The quality of the food can be good depending on the type of food ordered.
business	9iJa370SdefztNplnESMoQ	I love this sprouts. I come in often to pick up a few items for home dinner or lunch. They are always in stock with everything I need and often have sales. The customer service is fantastic and everyone is always very nice. The lunch sandwich section is really cool and very reasonable prices!	ALWAYS out of the things I need. Easier to shop on Amazon. Not worth the prices. The amount we have to spend here for one week is the same amount we would spend at other stores for 2 weeks. I've come back multiple times to try and give them more chances, but today was the worst.	The friendliest staff of any Sprouts stores I've been to. Special mention for Diana at checkout and one other gentleman (can't recall his name) that typically bags. The team at this location legitimately makes me look forward to shopping there. They make a relatively mundane task, brighter and more enjoyable.	I am convinced that all the people that work here are aliens! Not one person shoes any type of warm response even when my 2 year old happily sais Hi! Not even a smile cracked. Really? Never again will I shop there!	I come here primarily for the produce. It's much much cheaper than Whole Foods, Basha's, Frys, etc. It's pretty groovy in here and they offer a lot of organic / gluten free / vegetarian stuff. Yeah, that's not me. However the produce is fresh, cheap and plentiful.	This is the best Sprouts store of the many Ive shopped at. They have a salad bar. Olive bar. Fresh pressed juices. Tons of options for meals on the go. A soup bar. the fruit & vegetables are in good condition. And plenty stocked. I get at least 2 lunch meals from this Sprouts a week	They empty the salad bar way too early. Yesterday about 7: 15 pm it was light and bright outside and people were buying dinner items to take home. No salad bar! This is nuts!! 'Management' should be waterboarded.	I had an excellent experience with one of the managers, Christina. Was in a hotel and didn't have a microwave so her people heated up the prepared steak, etc. in the back for me. She's so generous! I love her!	This is a good Sprouts store with a salad bar that offers fresh pressed fruits and vegetables that are always in stock. The staff is generally warm and friendly and prices are about average. It also an ideal place for lunch and dinner pickups.	Sprouts is the grocery shopping experience that makes healthy living easy and affordable. That’s only if the food is in stock to start with. The staff doesn’t seem to care about in person shopper while filling online orders, sometimes cold and to busy to deal with customers. Fruits and vegetables are very well priced for organic and the meat is all free range and reasonably priced.	This Sprouts store is good for people who want fresh produce and more organic-style food. The produce is fresh and plentiful. The staff is mostly friendly and personable. They have extras like a salad bar and lunch sandwiches. In general, the store is recommended because of its friendly staff and plentiful, fresh produce.
business	B41kSVjdFOwOrZTuJaTF7g	Damn good Sichuan. Keep in mind that this is not regular Chinese food you normally see here in Mississauga. Be prepared you crap fire cause it is SPICY. Price is a little higher than the average Chinese food. Food wait times can be lengthy and service is mediocre but everyone comes for mainly the food. 4 / 5	Average across the board, a bit pricey for average though. Authentic food but service was not too friendly however efficient. Would recommend for those cold winter nights to warm up. Worth a try on lazy evenings when the group becomes indecisive of food choices...	Went there as a friend recommended the place. We ordered their famous Peking duck as my husband was craving for it. Our order came with a soup and a side dish. It was huge for two. We were satisfied and would definitely go back to the place.	This is the spot to get your Sichuan spicy food fix. The flavours are bold and authentic. You can order using an iPad. The only downside is that it is hard to wave down a server since they tend to be very busy. Although I like to dine in, I commonly get take out because the wait is less.	Worst service ever. Yes their food is good, but you will have to wait so long just to be seated when there are lots of tables available. The waiters there are rude and inattentive. Don't recommend coming here unless you're willing to wait and be served poorly.	This used to be a great place but my experiences have been unsatisfactory the last few times I came here. The servers hand you a sheet of paper write down your orders - which is fine, except they pretty much ignore you the entire time you're there. The food is mediocre and so unbelievably greasy you might as well have swallowed a bucket of oil.	Long waits for a table during peak times but food is amazing. Large portions and the best spicy, sliced beef I've had from any Sichuan place, including ones in Markham and Toronto. We also had bowls of Dan Dan noodles, which were huge and very flavorful!	Food and customer service both were worst!! Waste of money!!! Servers are always busy.. you have to look for them by yourself. No one is listening to you. Foods are very much pricy than it's quality. You have to wait long time for food. Overall this place is a mess. Very bad management.	The quality of the food is ok, but can be a tad overpriced.  The service is bad - for example waiting a while to be seated, or being ignored while waiting.	Even though the food is great, especially the authentic Sichuan dishes some items are overpriced for the amount of food. Depending on the night and time of day, expect long wait and sub-par wait service. Overall the quality of the food and service has gone down in recent months.	This Chinese restaurant has decent, authentic, spicy Sichuan food. However, the service is not good at all. The servers are inattentive and sometimes rude. The wait times are long. The food is also a bit on the pricey side. This is not recommended unless "authentic" Sichuan is more important than customer service.
business	BTcY04QFiS1uh-RpkR7rAg	I really like Harkins the only thing here is no reserved seating. We have a large family and need to always sit together. I also wish they had the recliners. I think Harkin's have the best popcorn and loyalty program. But due to the non reserved seats and recliners we aren't loyal to this theater. I want to be loyal though!	My favorite theatre in the valley to go to, always clean, and the staff is usually well mannered and ready to serve. Student discount is the biggest reason I go here over AMC because Harkins is a smarter business and offers better value to any customer. I will always go here first unless I have to go to one of the other guys.	Childcare, distance from my home, away from hustle of malls is why this place rocks. Harkins has it figured out, except Dan Harkins needs to not leave his dog in a hot car. But who cares, the dog lived... right?	Digital Screens makes for the best picture in town. However, the child care center is the main reason I give this place 5-Stars and it's why it's our favorite. Our 5 year old actually prefers to go to the kid's club than to see a movie with us!	Came here with my 2 year old daughter for our first date last night. Halfway through the movie she got tired ad wanted to go home and when the front desk saw us leave, she asked if everything was ok. We old her what happened and she gave us 2 free passes to come back again! Awesome! Clean place, great seating!	Our family enjoys coming to this theatre, especially because of the on site child care. The child care staff is friendly - they just require your child to be fully potty trained. Our son watched movies, played games, and did some crafts while my wife and I enjoyed our movie in peace. Great theatre, plus good food options are in the area.	Our regular theatre. Always clean and comfortable. Saw The Giver today and were 2 or 4 viewers! The staff is always helpful and nice. We appreciate the location and typically plenty of parking. We always have our souvenir cup to get a reasonable soda.	Best theater. Thanks Harkins. Love that I can butter my own popcorn. Great location and decent seating. (Some theaters have really awkward seating) well kept and great daycare set up for those who need it. Love that I can use my college I.d. to get a discount on tickets.	The theatre is clean and comfortable. The staff is helpful and nice, but does not offer reserved seating. It does have child care and a dedicated staff for that. The customer can butter their own popcorn. The location is great and school ID’s can yield a discount on ticket prices.	Harkins is a great movie theater situated in a peaceful location. Particularly worthy of mention is their on-site child care which features a kids club, a special discount for students with their ID, and a loyalty program. Staff is efficient, friendly and courteous. Overall highly recommended.	Harkins is the best place in town to catch a movie. Comfortable seating, friendly staff, and cleanliness make this theater stand out from the others in town. Perhaps the best feature is the onsite daycare. With crafts and  games children can have fun while parents enjoy a date night. The staff goes above and beyond to ensure a great experience at a reasonable price.
business	BncM7h87xJr7_-6CCfh3Xg	Britt did a cover up tattoo of mine and I could not be happier. The staff at illuminati is nice and supportive. It was the first tattoo location I've felt all good vibes. Britt is now the only artist I'll use for life, I'm so thankful for her talent.	Went in here for a walk-in and was greeted immediately by a friendly face. The staff was so polite and gave me all the information I needed to choose the perfect tattoo for me! Definitely will be coming back for my next one!!! Everything was so clean and organized, didn't feel rushed or uncomfortable at any moment.	My husband and I got matching tattoos of a heart today by Tommy Woodside. He's amazing he has a very light had, he's super nice, makes great conversation, and works with people really well. He's been tattooing for about 23 years and it really shows in his work, definitely book with him he's amazing.	I got inked by Dave, he's so amazing! Everyone that works there is great! Super friendly staff that makes you feel at home! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone looking for a great tattoo and a fun time!!	Got my nipples pierced here today by Terry. He did a great job making me feel comfortable and was very professional and answered all my questions thoroughly. It didn't hurt nearly as much as I expected it to which was great. I would definitely recommend coming here to others.	These guys were really awesome. Friendly, willing to work with you, not as surly as the artists in your average tattoo shop (who seem to be stuck up their own asses here in Vegas). Their prices were also extremely reasonable and they did a great job with my tattoo and my friend's. I will be seeing these gentlemen again.	Prime with illuminati tattoo was great. My wife had a lower back tattoo that needed to be covered up. He took his time made sure that he had everything that she wanted in the new art. Came out great and will be going to him for any future tattoos.	My sister and I stopped in at Illuminati Tattoo Co today to get matching tattoos. Tommy took great care of us. He helped bring our creation to reality with great placement and skillful use of colors. I love my new tattoo and am looking forward to scheduling my next session to start the work on my next tattoo.	they seem to have enjoyed the great service from the tatoo shop and this clearly shows how professional and they also showed how warm entertaining and friendly the service at the tatoo shop. it sure shows a good picture of the owner and the shop because the services were awesome and great to the customers and will be happy to always visit the place	Staff is very welcoming and helpful. Tattoos are high quality and service is excellent. Employees are very friendly and make great conversation while providing service. Business space is well taken care of and professional in appearance. Prices are very affordable for the quality provided. Overall, great atmosphere and highly recommended.	Illuminati Tattoo has friendly and supportive staff that is highly recommended by many of it's customers.  The Artists here take their time and do amazing work.  This is a clean, comfortable place with good vibes to come get inked.
business	CQQ1Ts26XqaDaF9SmRoUCw	I love this place! Even though it is kind of a far drive for me, I will not bring my cat anywhere else. The staff is amazing, the service is warm, the place is clean and they are open 24 / 7. What more could you ask for?!?!	Front office: excellent! Bright, caring, thoughtful.Surgeon: five star! Good work, followed up with phone call, great manner.Intake / tech: not so much. When done, tech came out to explain antibiotic meds. I informed him that I CLEARLY today the intake person that cat was already on Clavamox! Oops! Sorry!....	I have been taking my 4 year old boxer here for a while now. They are very friendly and knowledgeable here. My dog is very hyper and loving they were very loving to him and helped me feel as ease. I will continue to go here for all my dogs needs.	Great hours (7 am- 11pm everyday!) and great personnel. They also have boarding and grooming in office. I've been taking both my dogs here since 2010 and don't have a single complaint. I recently moved to N Scottsdale from old town and still go to this vet because they are so reliable.	won't be back, euthanasia was pretty traumatic for me, never saw it done that way & with such lack of empathy for the owner. Had to put my cat down because of the sky hi bill & that put me in shock.	I am new to the area, and this clinic is near my house. The staff here is amazing. Wonderful customer service and bed side manner from the front desk to the techs to the Doctors. As fellow pet owners, you know our pets are like our children, and they made them and me feel so comfortable. Will definitely be returning here!	Had to come back here yesterday because our dog hurt himself over the weekend. We had the same vet and while we had to wait about 3 hrs (walk in only, no appointments) she was very kind and gentle with our dog. Very happy with the service!	Had a great experience here last night with our sick cat. Staff was wonderful, very friendly and really took care of us and our boy. So thankful that this place is here and open 24 hours. I will definitely recommend them to everyone I know.	This veterinarian's office is well-liked for its service. The office is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The staff and doctors are friendly, caring, and knowledgeable. The personnel know how to make pets and owners at ease. This vet is recommended for emergencies and sick pets.	They have a great staff, are professional and provide needed services. Being open 24 hours is very helpful for pet owners. The staff is comfortable with animals and most have a good bedside manner. Everything is clean and along with the clinic there are also boarding and grooming services available. Overall, definitely recommend.	A great veterinary clinic that is open for most of the day. The staff is friendly and treat customers like family. The clinic is clean and brightly lit. The surgeons is experienced and knows how to take care of the pets.
business	D3ehpx1uKG5aLuaJgztYDg	The sign on the door says they open at 8, but when we arrived at 8: 05 it was closed, the lights were off, and no one was there. Waiting another 5 minutes didn't help. So, don't expect to stop by right at opening time if you are in a hurry like we were.	The guy working all the time is great, very down to earth and personable. He works too much! Give him a vacation, he deserves it. The coffee is amazing, great flavor. The iced Cafe White Chocolate is my go to. Highly recommend!	This is an awesome little coffee spot tucked behind a barber shop. The staff is super real and friendly. The tea is freshly brewed. You'll love the music if you don't like Top 20 garbage. And the ambiance is great.	Cool little place. I would imagine a lot of regulars go here but a worthy coffee shop either way. The Americano was very good and they had an unreal chocolate muffin with cream cheese on top more or less. Awesome. The service was friendly. Cool decor as well. Will go back.	There's lots of good things to say about this cafe.1) Small but lots of seating. Cozy.2) Wonderful espresso3) Nice baristas4) Very convenient location5) Prices are competitiveReminds me of cafes that I used to visit a lot when I lived in a smaller city. I defintely recommend!	I enjoyed the coffee and my husband was absolutely delighted with the shot of cubano especially because it's rare for places to make it. Very nice barista, friendly and talkative without being intrusive. It was fun being almost int the barber shop and watching men get their haircut. Fun atmosphere all around.	I love coming to my neighborhood coffee shop. Open mic nights, rotating drinks, burritos, good music, helpful staff, cool artwork, and a library make this place the amazing place that it is. The staff is really helpful and quick as well. Big ups to them!	I love this cafe, I'm so glad I stumbled upon it. The atmosphere is everything a cafe should be and the cappuccino was the closes to Italy I've come to in along time. Service is a little slow but definitely worth the wait. You can sit outside on a warm day. Great place to read or use your computer.	This is an enjoyable little coffee shop that is conveniently located in a nice neighborhood. The rotating menu and library are very enjoyable, and both the espresso and coffee are equally as good. The Italian ambience overall is wonderful. Make sure the coffee shop is open before going because the coffee shop doesn't always open on time.	The café offers good coffee and numerous other side dishes, from burritos to muffins. Some nights are open mic nights. The staff is friendly and helpful, and prices are competitive. The feel is cozy and the location convenient to other businesses. The seating is expansive and many different drinks are offered.	A great local coffee spot. From the friendly staff, to the delicious food, to the fun atmosphere, this place has it all. With a wide range of coffee, teas, and blended drinks it is everything a cozy coffee shop should be.  If food and coffee alone are not enough, the cool decor, open mic night and artwork add to the charm of this hidden gem.
business	GTNhbajbPNao5ITndlYy6Q	So many delicious options. We got wagyu beef and it was expensive AF but honestly amazingly good. A good alternative to St Lawrence Market (because of SLM shit hours). I would go back and try more options, I like their take a number system.	I picked up a frozen tourtiere for Christmas eve. It was easy to bake and absolutely delicious. The staff were incredibly helpful and I'm really looking forward to checking out some of their other offerings, including other pies and cassoulet. Can't wait to visit again.	I was out and about in Kensington Market on Sunday to pick up a bunch of different items for Mother's Day dinner. Stepped into Sanagan's on a whim and picked up the some of the biggest, juiciest and appropriately spiced pork sausages. Fair price point and great customer service--these guys know their meat.	I feel like I am going back in time when I walk into Sanagan's. The strangely familiar smell, the sawdust on the floor and actual animals in the display cases are rarely seen anymore in today's plastic wrapped meat-counters. I love the attention I get when I visit them, and have ben happy with the product so far.	Sanagans is a staple in Kensington and rightfully so! Their selections are great and reasonably priced. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and there are always a few people working so I never have to wait in line. I love stopping in here to peruse and always leave with something great.	The best butcher's place I've ever stepped into. This place has everything you need. Fresh, delicious, mostly organic! They also have a food bar that serves chicken, fries, and the likes. They have a few tables for you to sit and enjoy. Bit pricey but come here for meat to make a nice home cooked meal.	Sanagan's offers quality products and super informed service. No idea how to prep something? Just ask, and they'll tell you everything you need to know. They also offer amazing prepared foods, spices / seasonings / brines etc, and an awesome lunch selection (get the Sunday Roast - so good)	I purchased lamb sausages and Piri Piri chicken drumsticks.The sausages were incredibly fatty. I cooked a pound of them and ended up with 1 cup of orange fat.The chicken was not delicious and had a slimy mouthfeel.The staff was pleasant but the quality is not great. I won't be back.	This butcher shop manages to mesh modern and old-fashioned meat market characteristics very well. While it can be a bit pricey, the quality of the meat is well worth it, and the knowledge and friendliness of the staff is above average.  The piri piri chicken isn't great, but there are so many selections that are excellent. This shop is highly recommended.	Sanagan's defines an old-fashioned butcher. The staff is extremely knowledgeable, attentive, and friendly. and a number system is implemented, which makes the service very organized. The selection is extensive, but it is also expensive. That being said, the quality is worth the price. The establishment also offers some prepared foods, but there are only a few tables available for patrons wishing to dine in rather than take orders home.	Sanagan's butcher shop is one of the best around. Their customer service is top-notch. The staff is very knowledgeable, friendly, and enthusiastic about giving advice. The products are also very good quality, including the prepared meats. This is a very highly recommended butcher shop.
business	H2RgkjPs3W-CxbyygCJJew	Good service, clean restaurant, so so sushi. I think it's because we came right before they are getting ready to close but the sushi rolls weren't rolled very tight. The rice seemed to be normal white rice instead of sushi rice. My boyfriend really enjoyed his rolls.	Been here twice and both times were great.Had the seaweed salad, and several servings of sushi.The sushi was extremely fresh and tasted excellent. The service was prompt and the beers were cheap. I'll be returning in the future for sure!	First arrived asked to have miso soup and waiter completely forgot my order. The waitresses are very stand offish and have poor customer service. They handed me my food with no silverware or napkins. Never checked on me to see if things were fixed. Just horrible would not ever come back	Have been there for lunch 3 times. I'm not big on sushi, but the curry Chicken, mongolian beef and shrimp were all good. The service was a little below average, atmosphere was allright. A decent value - have not been there for dinner. Nonetheless, everything you would expect for lunch	The service may not be super attentive, but the prices are terrific, the happy hour is awesome, & the staff is friendly, if a bit lackadaisical. Definitely never a bad experience, & the beer choices are very fine!	This is my go to for Asian cuisine in Ahwatukee. The service is very quick and friendly and the food is delicious. The beer special is buy 1 and get the second for a $1. My favorite is the Mongolian beef great taste with a little heat. I highly recommend Pacific Gardens.	We were going to give it a try but I called to see if they have gluten free options and they said not we don't: (this is why they get one star / They could have said we have salads or learn to evolve & have a few options. Off to Picasso's or Pomegranate cafe where we can find healthy food.	Amazing sushi that is affordable and great service, too! Friendly staff and happy hour specials last all day!!! Does not close in the middle of the day like some sushi restaurants! Buy one get one for $.99 beers all day! So many good things to say about this place, I highly recommend it!:)	This venue may be hit or miss with food consistency and good service, but the prices are fantastic, especially the happy hour menu. The vibe is casual, beer choices are okay, and plenty of food is provided for the price. However, one day the food is great and the next it's not. The sushi is generally fresh, but not always rolled very tight. The seaweed salad is great, but there are very limited gluten-free options on this menu.. The service leaves a lot to be desired though.	Amazing and affordable sushi. The sushi tasted excellent and was extremely fresh. The food is very delicious and the service is very friendly and quick. The prices are great, the happy hour is amazing and the choice of beer is very fine.	The service for Pacific Gardens leaves a much to be desired but the food is typically good. The ingredients are not high end but fair in price with plenty of good deals to compensate. Does not have gluten free options.
business	I8e1_CZ1c76UaL7LQfsh4Q	Rude service. When I asked about why their delivery area was so small (I live 8 minutes away), the employee said 'We don't care.' They probably put the same effort into the stuff they call food. I would avoid this place. It would not surprise me if the employees were doing nasty things to the food before serving it.	Ordered a roast beef from this location at about 12: 15 I asked them to hold on delivery until 1: 00pm. I thought when you ask for hold on delivery that's also a hold on making the sandwich. Nothing but the onions and crispy chips saved this sandwich.	Too bad-they had excellent service etc. corporate decided they will no longer deliver beyond El Mirage and Bell Road. They have lost $30.00 per week to other companies (Literally 2 steps beyond imaginary boundaries). When they go out of business, due to competition, perhaps they will recognize you should convenience the customers. Good riddance.	I get hooked on the turkey tom more and more each time I have one! Very nice customer service at this location, (cant say the same for some of the others) and the hubby and 11 year old SSon love the vito. Good prices:)	Pretty horrible place subway, firehouse, blimpys, mr goodscents, cousins, Jersey mikes, safeway sub, pretty much any other sub place is 100000 times better, the staff was horrible the food tasted like it was left over from last week and this sub franchise has to be the worst in the valley.	Best sandwiches I've had in a long time! And they'll deliver--if you fall in their small delivery zone-- 1 sandwich to you. This comes in handy for me while I'm at work and hungry! I love the bread & their mayo. YUM! I usually order the beach club. No complaints from me!	The food I ordered was ok but the customer service was horrible. The young man taking my order was rude and had no personality. He didn't say hi or even greet me. The lady making my sandwich said hi and was more friendly. The food was not the best but what do you expect from a fast food sandwich shop!	WOW!!! Amazing customer service here. My wife made a large order and when I came to pick it up, everything was ready and they even loaded it into our car. Great Job Guys!!! We will be back	A food delivery service that covers a rather small area of delivery. Staff is generally not very courteous. The quality of the sandwich is generally good. Overall not recommended	The sandwiches tend to below par. This location offers both delivery and take out options, with the delivery area being rather limited. However, the timing is off with take out as it is apparent the sandwiches have been sitting for quite sometime. The customer service is also disappointing.	The sub shop isn’t going to win any awards soon but has reasonably priced, decent food. The staff and customer service all depend on the time of day. Their bread to meat ratio is not close to being equal. The highlight of the menu are the fries/chips and the turkey sub. Overall the place is clean and well kept but nothing to write home about.
business	IKpVBsOTixsnoU4r0Sc42A	That rating is based solely on the phone service when I called to place a delivery order just now. Rude could be a little on the strong sode, but is not an entirely inaccurate description. I will post more when we get our food I. 45 - 50 minutes.	The Tom kha is pretty good, panang curry was okay too but they are stingy on the meat and their tempura is more like fishstick breading, definitely not tempura. It was okay. Probably find a different place to eat next time.	Ordered tom kha today and opt for delivery. The soup came sooner than they had quoted which was nice, and the soup itself was delicious and the portion is enough to last a few days! The man who delivered it was also very kind. Will absolutely be ordering again! Thank you papaya Thai!	Ordered deliver thru Eat24 tonight. Mixed app - most items over cooked. The brownish dipping sauce had an off flavor. No idea what it was. Pad Woon Sen - Bland and no heat. Overall a let down. I had hoped I'd have the same experience as many of the others that had given good reviews on the delivery. Oh well.	Awesome place! Called in and told them we would be heading over and we were running late and they held the restaurant open for us until we got there. Truly nice people and great management. I seriously recommend you go. Love their appetizers!	I ordered takeout and was disappointed to find my Broccoli Delight hardly contained any broccoli. Five pieces max. What's worse, the Tom Yum soup tasted like spicy tomatoes. There didn't seem to be any lemongrass. Not even a hint. So disgusting, and contrary to what I ordered.	Chicken was undercooked. The curry was pretty good, very large serving.The place looks run down and it looks like the workers live there, looked dirty, worn and really old.I doubt we'd ever dine in and with the to go order under cooked we will not be ordering from Papaya again.	Ordered via Grubhub while at a sand volleyball tournament. The food was great! Who knew pumpkin could make a great curry! Then i read the reviews on here and was like uh oh. Never the less, this experience the food was great. I took off a star just because they took longer than expected.	The staff is mostly kind and give good customer service. However, the restaurant looks dilapidated and dirty. The quality of the food varies. The food is sometimes under cooked or over cooked. The dishes may have limited amounts of the main ingredients, such as meat or broccoli, but the servings of the dishes are very large. Soups and curries are good.	There is an off flavor in the brownish dipping sauce and most items over cooked. The waiting time was longer than expected. The place looked run down and looks like the workers also live there, looked really old, worn and dirty. The Tom Yum soup had the taste of spicy tomatoes. Probably look for a different place to eat another time.	Many of the customers of this restaurant have been disappointed by both the food and service. The dishes are generally lacking either in taste, quality, or simply do not meet expectations. The staff has received mixed reviews in terms of customer service. While have exhibited flexibility in accommodating customers, they can also come off as rude over the phone.
business	JKmhHlmboFEsSSxPcYwxww	I got my dog a little treat for his birthday and he absolutely loved it! It was a peanut butter cookie and it was easy and soft for him to eat. It wasn't expensive at all either and was cute to use for some photos of him too!	Just moved to the area and I'm very picky about my little one and who grooms her. Happy to say that Courtney did a fabulous job and Peanut was happy and relaxed during her first grooming visit. I would highly recommend Courtney and Bogart's!	Stopped by here to pick up some honest kitchen which I usually buy online just ran out and needed some right away. Both the cashiers were rude, trying to rush me out of the store and not helpful at all. You'll never be finding me here again after that kind of customer service.	So far I've had nothing but positive experiences here. Great customer support, friendly greeting, passionate employees more than willing to get you a healthy treat for your furr baby, and some gluten free food. Love the selection of food, snacks, and treats, but the backroom groomers are average at best.	What an amazing selection of pet stuff with great prices. We travel to Vegas 4-5 times a year and will make sure this is one of our stops since we always travel with our dog. Better selection than any pet store in LA!	Love the doggie wash. Our pup is 130 pounds of love and Because of his size I don't trust anyone washing him, but me. This is great alternative of washing a giant dog at home and having half of the house wet during the process.	It's so nice to have a pet store with employees that genuinely care and will take the time to help you make decisions buying the right food for your pet! Such a wide variety of quality food at competitive prices. Highly recommend!!	My dogs love everything I buy them especially the pizza! Icarrot cake for her birthday, looked so cute and smelled delicious... I've bought cannolis, donut cookies, doggie o's, and coconut bites and will continue going! Highly recommend	This is a solid pet store with good prices and a nice variety of items including tasty treats. There's a groomer and a self-use doggie wash that get the job done well even with bigger dogs. The employees are friendly and passionate although cashiers can be a bit rude and make the customer feel rushed. Overall, a good selection of food, snacks and treats with a good although slightly inconsistent staff.	This pet store specializes in pet treats and food. The treats are very well liked. There is also a grooming section. The groomers are average to good. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and passionate about their work. Overall, this store is recommended for treats and food, and worth a try for grooming.	This pet store provides spirited customer service and support. There are many treats to spoil dogs with, especially on birthdays. This pet store also offers a grooming service that will wash dogs of any size. Everything is offered at an affordable price.
business	LEASX4wn1U1TAmwQfsDtIw	I am going to keep this one short and simple. Six beers for $15 on the Strip. Good luck finding a better deal. Plus a juke box playing some great Oldies and Classic Rock. It may be dirty, old, and smoky but Slots of Fun is a nice place to chill for a bit.	When you walk into a place and even the air feels dirty something is amiss. It's all electronic games. No tables with real people dealing. We went out of our way to check it out and were vary disappointed. Not worth the walk from anywhere.	Had to Valet @ CIRCUS CIRCUS... umm well, not many new machines, you can def say this is a hole in the wall casino. You will find great deals on alchohol and snacks / hot dogs etc if thats your stee-lo.	This place is a real dump but I love it! You can't have every Vegas experience be 1st class; sometimes you have to get down and dirty with the locals and some low rollers. The drinks are cheap I think u get 2 pitchers of beer for $10 (beer pong)	My husband and I took a special side trip to Circus Circus just to try out Slots A Fun. Maybe this place has just lost its charm, but I couldn't find the hot dog stand (I think its gone) and there was just an overpriced Subway inside. Nothing special at all about this place and wouldn't go back.	If you're looking for the cheap hot dog, apparently, they don't sell them anymore. There's just a Nathan's cart near the entrance that offers two piss ant hot dogs for five bucks. No reason to ever step foot in this place.	Great place came here when I lived in Vegas, Jersey Joe is the best bartender in Vegas and one of the nicest guys I have ever met. One of the bartenders is a pompous a * * (Slade). Cheap beer and fun times, nothing like the Wynn, and it is connected to circus circus but kids are not allowed in here!!	1 star for the nasty 99 cent 1 / 2 pound hot dog that is uneatable even when starved. But 5 stars for having dime slot machines and video poker machines from 1983 and those old games where the quarters shoot out and try to push other quarters down to you. After everything, it's an average spot if your in the area to check out.	This was a top casino years ago but has drastically gone downhill. It’s now extremely overpriced but also the quality of food and drinks has gone down. It’s very old, outdated, musty and just feel overall dirty. It could use a good cleaning. Some of the slots are outdated but still fun.	An adults only outdated, dingy, dirty casino attached to the famous Circus Circus. The slot machines are inexpensive but they are old and unexciting This used to be a spot for tasty hot dogs but they have been replaced with cheap, disgusting hot dogs.The only positive about this place is the inexpensive beer.	This is definitely more of a low-budget casino, but it has it's share of good and bad qualities. Everything is electronic. There are no dealers. The selection of games is on the small side, and a lot of them are pretty dated. The bartenders are generally great and this is one of the cheapest places to buy a beer on the strip. There's also a fantastic jukebox here. The atmosphere is fun, but not as classy as other nearby places, and kids are not permitted.
business	LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw	Really disappointed. Just order chicken tikka for lunch via postmates. The chicken was dry, minimal sauce (which was probably the most flavorless tikka masala I've ever had) and the salad had zero dressing on it. Will give them another shot but really disappointed.	Food blew my mind so good! Prices were great and so was customer service. Got a meal it was huge portion have dinner for tonight, thanks! Service was great, very nice staff! Got and would recommend chicken shawarma and tikka masala! Both fantastic!	Fresh food yum. I stopped by during Ramadan for the late night buffet! It's over at 10z for 16.99. It's a really great way to try everything they have to offer. I wish they had a few more options for veggies but other than that great food	I always have the chicken curry and can't stop eating until I have finished everything. Always walk out of there feeling way too full. Today I decided to keep it light and have a lentil soup and tabbouleh. It was delicious and I am full again! How did that happen?	Look! Eat here and experience great food. Great food, and dirt cheap prices. The quantity of food you receive will make it almost impossible to finish. The people working there are great to chat with, and are good at making suggestions. They have a market attached. I wish they would offer cooking classes.	I love this place. It's our go to spot for a quick lunch at work. I highly recommend pretty much everything. The chicken burger is my favorite and I avoid eating the massive quantity of rice that is served with the options on the hot bar.	Another awesome meal. Had the kufta kebab meal which came with huge side of rice and 3 kebabs that were sublime. Not greasy and cooked perfectly. Also had the garlic Naan which was hot out of the over and it was the bomb! Just go there an eat, you won't be sorry.	I don't even live in Pittsburgh but anytime we are on a road-trip and Pittsburgh is along Route... we take a two hour detour just for Salem's Grill! The chicken burger is best I've ever had. The meat curry and and their spinach is another must try! We wish they had market like this in every state!	This restaurant offers large portions of delicious, flavorful foods at cheap prices. The curries are the main attraction, but there is of course the tikka masala, soups, kufta kebab,  naan, etc. all with a hot bar/buffet. The service makes sure that a wonderful experience is to be had.	Salem's Grill in Pittsburgh is a well established place to eat. The quality of the food is excellent, the prices are wonderful, and the overall experience is awesome. Customer service is top notch and the staff are nice and very friendly. Quantity of food is over the top and there is a market within.	Great food, great experience, great prices that are worth it. Most customers love the food, however some customers might have a different opinion. Things go bad some of the times, and the unsatisfied customers might have witnessed this. Majority of the customers love this, and that is the great thing.
business	LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng	My new favorite for Indian food in Champaign. The downtown location is perfect and the owners have put some love and care into the space. The dishes are not your typical run-of-the-mill recipes. The sauce on the Tikka Masala, for instance, has a smokey flavor I love. The wine selection is nice too. Who knew wine paired well with Indian food?	I love the creamy curries that Himalayan has, and although it may be expensive (relatively), I personally love coming here whenever I'm looking for lavish Indian meals. I always get the classic butter chicken, naan, and Shahi paneer. I'm a huge fan!	Really good curry chicken. I enjoyed my meal, tasted pretty authentic being that my family is from the Caribbean and eats curry all the time. My boyfriend enjoys their butter chicken. Everything tastes good with white rice and the naan bread!	I came here two days in a row because dang this place has some great food! Both times, I came during the lunch hour and honestly, the service was on point! Friendly and attentive. I enjoyed the rice puff salad with avocado, garlic naan and the pistachio chicken. D to the lish!	We loved the food here. The service was very good. The Dosa is totally authentic! Thin and crispy and full of curry potatoes. We came back a second time in one week just for more Dosa! The Himalayan lamb curry was really good as well. We'll definitely be regulars.	I'm in town on business and this is across from the Hyatt. First, they have done a great job with the renovation on the property! Next, the food was delicious. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and ate every morsel. Can't wait to come back with more people, so I can enjoy the ambiance and share more options!	My friends birthday was this evening and this was the place she chose to go! I had always seen it in passing, but had never been. Let me tell you - don't hesitate to stop! I had the Chicken Tikka Masala with mild sauce and it was amazing! The restaurant was clean and inviting with great customer service! I will be back!	Really enjoyed dinner here! Their butter chicken and Bhuna ghost were great. The starters were pretty good except the pani puri was missing the sweet chutney. The portions were a little small for the price of the food. Overall great experience though.	This is truly an authentic Indian restaurant. It's very clean and offers a relaxing and welcoming atmosphere. The service is on point, attentive, and friendly, but the prices are a little high for the portion size. There are a variety of curries to choose from, and the Chicken Marsala, Classic Butter Chicken, and Shahi Paneer are exceptional. The naan is great, too. Also, the establishment has a wine selection, which pairs surprisingly well with the dishes.	The state of the restaurant has a fancy feel to it on the inside without the prices. Everything on the menu has an Indian twist but still very authentic and is really tasty. The curry chicken and the rice puff are the stars of the menu.  It has a very large wine bar that pairs with the dishes. The service is always on point too.	This Indian restaurant is very well-regarded. The food is great; the Chicken Tikka Masala in particular is very well-liked. The atmosphere is also excellent, with friendly, efficient customer service and a newly-renovated interior. The only caveat is that the price is a little high. Overall, this restaurant is highly recommended.

business	Mt3FH0HY2E-GHzLuKPxJug	Ordered Mario's delivery and have been in the restaurant before and both were amazing experiences. The food is delivered promptly and is so hot and fresh. Their chicken is perfect - so juicy!! And so well priced. Delivery guy is always friendly. And don't forget to get their piri piri sauce it's THE BEST!	The gold standard in Portuguese chicken. You want the best, just come here. The level of attention and dedication these guys have to make sure they put out the best product is what sets them apart from everyone else. I heard a new location is opening downtown soon!	We love going to marios for a quick chicken purchase. The staff is very friendly they will add some Piri piri sauce to your chicken and cut it all up for you. They send it home with you in a nice little thermal bag to keep it warm. Just be careful because the sauce does start to leak out after some time:)	Work at the hospital and our group frequently order from this place... The chicken is always fresh.... Juicy and perfectly cooked.... We always call in before we pick up Cuz the line during lunch hour can get really long at times... The potatoes are really flavorful as well... Good choice for dine in as well...	Very fast and friendly service. The chicken was moist and the piri piri hot sauce was delicious. Got steamed vegetables which was good. Next time i will try the potatoes and rice when i can eat carbs again. $10 for half chicken meal. I will be back often!	The chicken is the best in Mississauga. (Short of Portugal, Toronto is where you find the best). Customer service is not their forte. I've followed Mario's BBQ for over 15 years, so I have a soft spot for them. I prefer their chicken over Brasas.	One of the most flavorful Portuguese chicken situated in the heart of Mississauga! Perfect dinner solution whenever you don't feel like cooking. What you get for the price is ridiculous! The rice, chicken and potatoes goes together so well.. Must ask for the piri piri sauce, it makes the meal that much better!	Great food but can be a hit and miss. Today the chicken was really dry, rice was uncooked and oh my the lady taking the order whom I assume is the owner gave the worst customer service ever. The jane location is much better.	This restaurant's specialty is Portuguese chicken. It is juicy, fresh, and delicious. It is recommended to enjoy the chicken with Piri piri sauce. The value is great, one can expect a lot of food for the price. Although most of the time the staff are friendly, occasionally the customer service at Mario's is lacking. The Portuguese chicken is often regarded as the best that can be found outside of Portugal.	Mario’s offers fresh and quick food, specializing in Portuguese chicken dishes and related sauces. The value there is high, with every dish going well with one another. To go orders come in a thermal bag in order to stay warm and selections range from potatoes to steamed vegetables and rice.	The chicken here is usually always very juicy and well cooked. It comes with piri piri sauce which is very tasty. The rice and potatoes are also full of flavor and they go well with the chicken. Pricing is affordable and delivery is always prompt. Pick up and dine in are also great choices as well.
business	NVHlTy9TXFJQpUzZKuEeWw	Their carry-out specials are great! The toppings are like extra toppings and the crust is crisp n chewy, I've read some ppl ask fir extra sauce but I thought it was good enough, unless u like saucy pizzas. Overall really good value n pizza were ready to pick up in 15mins. Nice guys that work there too...	We had the bellisima and a large pepperoni pizza. I enjoyed the zucchini in the pizza but the tomatoes made the pizza a little watery, and the cheese was a little rubbery. Other than that, I enjoyed the crust not too thick and not too thin. The pepperoni pizza was better. They delivered to our hotel and had easy online ordering.	i love their pizza! I've had just a basic bacon pizza and it was so delicious. Thtey're always so friendly, and they know exactly who we are once we ask for chicken & bacon. haha Their prices are really reasonable too.	This place is great. We basically selected it randomly from Yelp and they delivered right to our hotel room. The process was nice and easy and the pizza was awesome!!! Two large pizzas were very reasonably priced and plenty for a family of 6. I will definitely order from them again the next time I'm in Vegas!	horrible service ever. if i could id put zero stars horrible service ordered a pepperoni pizza and sent me a cheese pizza and told me they can send me video of them making my pizza correct when clearly its wrong no type of customer service at all also called us retards. do not go here horrible place horrible customer sevice	DISCLAIMER: I did not eat here. I thought it was a problem that the only way I knew I was in a pizza joint is because there were pizza boxes on the wall. It didn't even smell like pizza. It was confusing.	Meh... the pizza dough just ok, yuck sauce, good toppings and cheeses. More onions when I order 'add onions for $1'. More toppings on the actual pizza would be good. They have that 'good ranch' though! I wouldn't Order from here again, as I think there are much better options available.	Great place to eat! Customer service was excellent. Did. A late night order, it arrived within the time frame given. Food was hot & as ordered. Chicken Philly, chicken fingers, double bacon cheese burger & cheese pizza was GREAT! I definitely recommend this place.	This is a great place. The process was easy, nice and the pizza was amazing. Their carry-out specials are cool.  Food are as ordered and hot. The  Customer service was perfect. Their prices are very reasonable. Overall, it is a really good value and their delivery is very fast.	The pizza here can be ordered for pick up or delivery with occasional miscues.  Sometimes the pizza ordered is not the pizza given.  Overall flavor of the toppings and crusts are slightly below average, but the staff are generally friendly.	This pizza place is overall pretty good. The pizza itself is fine, not spectacular, but generally good. The service is generally very good. They deliver to the hotel, and the pizza is ready for pickup quickly. The price is pretty reasonable. It is recommended as a reasonably good, moderately priced pizza place.
