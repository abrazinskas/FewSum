business	NWh0MGOPFAy7yElepNtIxg	Poor quality food. Steak sandwich with mushrooms had mushrooms than steak on it. Steak was stone cold. I asked for a fresh one and it was so so. I didn't finish it. My girlfriends salad was called a 'chopped salad' the lumps of lettuce were never chopped. Barely any chicken in it either. Poor experience	I love this place, everything tastes good and I love the healthy choices. I would prefer a more friendly and professional staff. But I guess all the 'to cool', pierced, tattoo'd people need to act like they don't really give a st # t so everyone knows they are cool.	Loved everything we ordered. We got a beet salad, the teriyaki chicken and forbidden rice bowl, and iced tea. Would definitely return here again in a heartbeat. It was cute, clean and the prices were right. Focus is on healthy eating, which is my favorite!	I've recently found this charming new restaurant although it's been around for many years. I love it. The food is really good and I just had the best service ever from Ezra. She's kind, genuine, informative, real perfection in the restaurant world. And best of all great smile! Keep up the good work chop shop!	Had to go out to eat after eating a salad here. Very expensive which I can deal with if you receive a healthy portion. Could hardly see the quinoa and kale salad it was so puny. R.I.P. off!!!!	Great spot. Went there tonight for the first time. Club sandwich was fantastic. Friendly staff. Comfortable seating. Quiet and inviting. Indulged on some toffee cookies for desert. Milk too ‼. Everything is fresh and homemade. Very reasonable prices too.	ChopShop is the greatest versatile spot because you could literally eat all three meals of your day at this spot. From the breakfast sandwiches and açaí bowls, to the wraps and salads, and finally their protein bowls, ChopShop has it all! My favorites are the Moroccan Turkey Wrap and the Chicken Teriyaki Protein Bowl, you won't be disappointed trying either of these.	Perfect! Real food. Quality choices. Fast. Great service. Not just various combinations of corn, wheat and sugar on the menu. If you only want more of that, go somewhere else. If you want food that will nourish your body, come here. We will definitely be back!	The beauty of this place is that it has high quality food and the menu has something for everyone anytime of the day. Overall the staff is friendly but depending on the day the wait might be long. For the price, everything is fresh and homemade.	The restaurant is a small sandwich-and-salad type that emphasizes a more healthy style. The food is generally well-regarded, and the restaurant is clean, has a nice atmosphere, and friendly waitstaff. The restaurant is recommended for those who are interested in healthier, less mainstream ingredients such as kale or quinoa.	ChopShop restaurant offers a healthy and nutritious variety of dishes. Staff is efficient, warm and friendly but lacks some measure of professionalism. The food quality is about average and the environment is comfortable and inviting. Overall a recommended place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.
business	Nbhpg1TbDwtMuyh9ZIPceA	This place was awful. I ordered tamarind duck and pad thai to go. It was like getting last weeks garbage. The food was very old, dried out, too tough to eat and I ended up throwing it all in the trash. Total disappointment.	I stumbled across this place by accident when a friend of mine was at churchs chicken. This place is incredible, the restaurant is spotless the staff was courteous and helpful, they also have orange chicken on the menu, but i highly recommend the panang curry, cant wait to go back	It was okay but we were expecting more based on the reviews. The owner was very pleasant and engaging in conversation. The peanut sauce on the Pad Thai was delicious however the chicken was dry and my husband's sweet and sour chicken was more breading than meat and left him unsatisfied. Maybe it was an off day?	This was one random little Thai restaurant that I found on yelp.. and I'm happy I did. It was quaint and the service was great. The lady was so sweet, And food was awesome! I highly recommend this place if you're craving authentic and quick Thai food!	I had Panang Curry and J had Thai Spicy Noddles. We have had Thai food all over the world and this is as good as any we have had. The service is great and the prices are low. What else can you ask for.	A little scary outside, inside a real gem. Family gives attentive, friendly service. If something is not up to your expectations, they will work to make it right. This is genuine Thai food, with spice levels to match. Love the curries.	Awesome little Thai place! The food is amazing, my wife and I both loved our food! Entree portions are generous, and they offer awesome lunch deals for $6.95. So happy to finally have a great Thai restaurant on our side of town!! We'll definitely be back!!	We got the Thai Fried Rice, egg rolls and many others. Fresh veggies, perfectly cooked rice and egg rolls! Thai Tea was delicious. Good portions, not too much, friendly service: -). I look forward to going back and trying the curry.	This place is a small family owned Thai restaurant.  The service is amazing, very kind, talkative, and helpful when necessary.  The food is very good, particularly the panang curry is highly recommended.   They give generous portions at very reasonable prices. Overall this place is recommended for authentic quality Thai food.	This small Thai restaurant is known for its good service, courteous staff and authentic food. While the dishes are generally tasty, the meat can be dry or overcooked. They offer economic lunch deals and generous entree portions.	Great Thai restaurant, the staff as well as the manager are warm and friendly, food is usually good and spicy but can be hit and miss. Prices are fair and customer service is really great. Generous portions and clean environment. Overall recommended place.
business	Ohu6w8_RYE5KdHEWGdBjXQ	Went to see our favorite artist last night (Gregory Alan Isakov) and were a little disappointed. Beautiful and clean building and we'll forever love Greg but we didn't love the venue. The acoustics were off, the seating was strange (hard to see and hear) and rather than fostering a welcoming visit the whole ordeal felt really rushed.	MAC is a great venue. Matthew Morrison was kinda boring though. The song choices sounded the same throughout the night. I almost wished he would stop singing and let the symphony play. The symphony was amazing. I would definitely go see them again. Great talent.	Been coming here for years. Many shows here and never a disappointment. Great seats all around. Great prices. Great restaurants near by. I recommend coming here even if it's just to walk around. They have free outdoor shows often. I love my experience here.	My favorite theater in Phoenix! Relatively new, and part of an arts complex with multiple theaters classes and loads of events throughout the year. Theater has no bad seats and the events are super fun. Come by and spend some $$in downtown Mesa. Also the Light Rail that goes here too.	Great place to see some interesting art, but only cell phones (no flash) pictures are allowed. The Phoenix Art Museum allows non-flash pictures with regular cameras and is a great place to get some interesting, unique pictures. It is sad the Mesa Arts Center is not as open to editorial photography as its larger counterpart.	I love the Mesa Arts Center. The concert halls and displays that come through are always great. Plus the facility itself is really top notch and very well updated. Hopefully downtown will continue to revive a bit and match the quality of the Arts Center as the city continues to help develop a healthy and thriving downtown.	No lie, I'd pay $20 more to see a concert here than I'd pay at 99% of the venues I've been to. Clean, booming sounds with crisp highs and lovely mids throughout the Fiona Apple show only make me wish more bands I love would come through Mesa.	Horrible seating very very disappointed at the show for The Who's line is it anyway and very very disappointed since I'll show you the attachment photo of my view of the stage and what I can see the ikeda theater has horrible balcony seating. Stay away from seats 3,4 balcony 11.	The Mesa Arts Center is a clean modern place to see a variety of concerts and performances.  Almost all the seats are great, and it is set up well for quality sound throughout the building. The area around the facility downtown is improving as well. Overall this building is recommended for a fun experience.	Good venue with a good variety of events all year round, including free outdoor shows. However, the seating options are inconsistent, as are the acoustics. Sometime it's great, but sometimes it's really hard to see and hear the performers. Overall an exciting and well-located venue right downtown, but it doesn't always offer a good audience experience.	The Mesa Arts Center is a great venue that has been open for a number of years. The facility is very well kept and has a great value for the type of shows that perform there. A few seating locations have shown to be not optimal. Free shows in the outdoor venue are often done here.
business	OkC86YtZ0Nm19my5F4GGrQ	I am not overwhelmed. Been here twice and found the food to be just ok. Had the strip steak (38 $) on my most recent visit. Good flavor but the meat was tough. My daughter loves the ambiance so we will be back.	First time going here and i was impressed. Very cozy with a great vibe. Staff is very polite (called me sir) and batender was very knowledgable about the wine. I would go back anytime. Had some apps but I'm sure the food would have been awesome.	We were greeted cordially and given a prime outside table for 4 w / o a reservation.Service was great from Angel.We had a true Tartine experience 2 of us had duck confi tartines one chicken and my pork was slightly dry the others were awesome.The House Red wine was great snd a great value.	My fiance and I really enjoyed eating here for dinner on a special night out. She especially loved the cheese plate and french onion soup. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here, especially the warm hospitality from the owner who was there at dinner and welcomed us.	I'm not sure why I was so hard with my first review of Tartine. The food is really good and although you are right on top of your neighboring table, that doesn't make it a 3. Maybe I was being too selective that day...	The best combination of atmosphere, food, and 'vibe' in Cleveland. Would be great if they took reservations, but this is the rare place that gets me to suspend my usual 'no reservations / no business from me' policy.	Love the atmosphere of this place. It tends to attract a slightly older crowd but that is okay by me! The Brie was very good but the French onion soup was just okay. Quite a bit if oil in it and it tasted under seasoned to me. I should have gotten the beet salad like my friend did! Excellent wine list.	Amazing. Excellent choice for lunch. Baked Brie and crab cake appetizer. Perfect. Lamb stew over phylo pastry had just the right amount of burgandy. Steak A Poivre was a small portion, amazing taste and cooked as ordered. Outstanding choice for family, friends or customers. Great service was a serendipity.	Tartine is a nice place with a combination of good food and great atmosphere. Staff and manager are very hospitable and courteous. Their Baked Brie is a good option for lunch. Excellent wine list, but meat can be sometimes tough/dry. Recommended place.	What sets this restaurant apart from others is the service and atmosphere. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and the atmosphere is excellent. The food is fine, not the best in town, but good enough not to detract from its strengths. Overall, this is a highly recommended restaurant.	Been here twice and the food is quite okay. Good flavor but tough meat. Great vibe and very cozy. Very polite staff and the bartender is quite knowledgeable about the wine. The atmosphere of this place is very lovely.
business	Q2ZNaN3p8s_-XXjBWyY2qA	Had a top sirloin steak today with mushroom and potatoes and the meal was great. Personally, I am not a big fan of letting the steak soak in butter, but the sizzle sounds nice when the steak gets there. It's a decent steak house and I'll come back for sure.	If you blink you might miss this gem across the street from Mather High School. Family owned - super sweet, great service - pride in every dishEvery bite better than the nextBrewed THAI Iced Tea is the perfect finisherWill tell friends and FOR SURE return	It is great but compared to other Ruth's Chris in North America, both the service and the food are not as top levels as they should be here. Thus, 3 instead off a regular 4 or 5. But the prices are as high.The place is pretty noisy as well, probably because it is in the basement with a low ceiling.	The best filet minion in Toronto. Super smooth and melts in your mouth. Came here for winterlicious, great price point to try out different things. I had the Caesar salad as an app and I wasn't impressed. I also got to try the stuffed chicken I must say it was Delish.	4 stars for the amazingly soft and tender steak! Everything else weren't too great but the steaks at Ruth's Chris are hands down my favourite for now. Had a steak from here for the first time and now I'm hooked!	Hey Everyone! Ruth's Chris Steak House is soooo delicious! I love it and am impressed every time. The steak comes out sizzling hot and is so moist. It's perfect! If your craving a really good steak and want to spend a little bit more then your typical restaurant, I highly recommend it!!	Got the filet with a side of Mac and cheese. Steak was cooked very well, tried to be a little too fancy with the Mac just needed to keep it simple. All in all good would have just gone to the keg if I had a choice.	First time at this restaurant. From the greeting at the door, through the servers and other staff, service was impeccable. Had the bbq shrimp and petit filet and my husband had the lobster bisque and petit filet. Cooked to perfection. Sides were lobster mac and mushrooms. Delicious. Recommend highly for a special dinner or to start the year off right.	The service at Ruth's steakhouse is serviceable though the location can be a bit loud. The food is made well and is generally good but has a small possibility to be on the bland side of things, however it is all priced well for visiting costumers.	This is a decent steak house. The greetings at the door, the servers and other staff, service are impeccable. The food is great, cooked  to perfection, the steak comes out sizzling hot and is so moist, super smooth and melts in the mouth.	The Ruth's Chris Steak House that's sits across Mather High School may be part of a franchise, but it run by a family that offer great customer service via servers and cooks. The butter soaked steaks are soft and hot, and can come with potatoes, mushrooms, mac and cheese, and other sides. There's also bbq shrimp, lobster bisque, and other dishes to round out the menu.
business	QNfh79NwsNnl-AngRhg2ww	Kingyo never disappoints whether you are in Vancouver or Toronto.Their pressed mackerel is my favorite and a definite must try if you go.It is a bit expensive if you order mainly sashimi and sushi, but if you get their stone pot rice bowls or some noodles (tantan noodles!) they will help fill you up a bit more and they are always good.	Hostess was outrageously inexperienced. Gave random, false wait time and was still unable to accommodate a party of 2 with a table after having waited more than double the time as promised. That's 1.5 hr wait. No systematic booking system but a simply old note pad. Don't bother coming without reservation. And don't trust the hostess.	Ordered at 9: 15 and dishes started coming out in an hour, even for the most basic dishes. Drinks took about 30 minutes to come out. Ordered short ribs at 9: 15 and they came out at 11: 15. Right before the store closes. Never again and don't recommend.	Food is A-OK! Was a bit pricey, approx. $130 for 5 items and not full at all..... (could be because I eat a lot.... haha). Even thought the server explain each dish, my friend and I still don't what we were eating.... Probably won't come back again	It's ok, nothing special. I still think Sushi Run is better. Their price is kind of high for little amounts of food. Hubby and I ordered 5 assorted sashimi and we only got about 10 pieces for $27. Spicy tuna sushi had too much rice. The only cool thing about this spot is that it's actually Japanese owned.	They have limited amount for the deluxe lunch bento, which I recommend. The portion might not look a lot, but once you start eating you will get full in the end. I also tried the katsu-don bento, which is very good. So, make sure more than 2 people go so you can try variety from the menu.	Now I don't need to wait for trips to Vancouver to get my fix. This is the best Japanese tavern in town. It's much more comfortable than Guu (chairs have backs). The Tuna Tataki is brilliant. Try the addictive Pork Ramen.	I love Kingyo, I'm always satisfied when I come here and have yet to order something I don't like. A couple of staples I always order are, the sashimi salad, tako wasabi, hamachi cheek, ebi shrimp the green tea matcha dessert.	The Food is okay, but quite expensive. The tuna was spicy and too much rice in the sushi. The price is quite high for the small quantity of food. The hostess was very much inexperienced and was unable to accommodate a party of two. Get a reservation before coming.	The good thing about this Japanese restaurant is that the food is good. The service, however, can be very slow. It is also pretty expensive, especially given the amount of food served. Overall, this is not very well recommended unless price and wait times are not an issue.	The prices for this restaurant are fairly high for a relatively small amount of food.  Wait times can sometimes take over an hour. The food is pretty good, particularly the sashimi. Overall it's a mixed back, but this place is moderately not recommended.
business	QUs_7nqxo0xYE-KazHlx5A	This hotel is awesome. It is clean and new looking. When you walk into your room, it feels like you're the first person to stay in it. It has an indoor pool and hot tub. I loved the 5: 30 kickback - pretty much free dinner!	This hotel surprised me. It had great front desk people who checked me in with no issues late at night, a filling breakfast, and comfy bedrooms. It was a great place to stop and rest before driving up the mountains to Flagstaff.	My family stayed there over New Year's from California as we attended the Fiesta Bowl in nearby Glendale and I have to say I was really happy with our visit. The breakfast was solid, the room was nice and clean and the price was awesome. I'd stay here again.	We recently stayed here with a big group for a wedding that was taking place nearby. The customer service was exceptional! We had to ask for numerous extras and they were more than willing to help us! The hot breakfast was excellent as was the drink and snack hour in the evening. I would highly recommend this hotel!!	I have since stayed at this hotel two more times and I continue to be impressed. I remembered the staff and they remembered me and even made sure I got the best room they had in my price range. Excellent customer service in a nice and professional environment. Definitely what this traveler is looking for.	Had not planned another overnight but pax needs changed so here I am. Cutter Aviation at Deer Valley Airport set this room up for me. I've stayed here previously and sure like. All is just right. Definitely an excellent choice near this airport.	Checked in last night with a large group of people and gotta say: the staff is super professional and very nice. Clean, quiet rooms. Amenities are quite as nice as the Marriott (small pool), but there is free WiFi (connection is good and consistent) and breakfast and dinner snacks come with your room. So, good value.	Great experience here! Very affordable, clean and had a great free breakfast. But if your that couple where one of you gets really cold, bring a blanket because the bedding is thin. I'm very picky with cleanliness of hotels and I was satisfied!:)	This hotel offers an excellent filling hot breakfast.  They also offer dinner and snacks that can be delivered to your room.  The rooms are very clean, the price is excellent, and customer service is great as well. This hotel is highly recommended.	This hotel aims to please and is successful in doing so. The staff is exceptional is every way. The hotel looks clean and modern, and the price is reasonable. There is a pool, free WiFi, and good food. Highly recommended for any visitor in the area.	This property features a staff who is attentive and friendly.  The complimentary breakfast has a variety of delicious items.  The evening snacks are a great added bonus.  The housekeeping staff does a great job on the rooms and public areas.  The hotel looks brand new!  The pool is a great addition.  The only drawback is that the bed linens are on the thin side, but this can be remedied by bringing a blanket.  This is a great property!
business	Q_BDMqf4tLrS_44g38dqXQ	The seating in the dining area is pretty bare. Service was very fast, even had we not been occupied with the chips and salsa.I get the same thing pretty much every Mexican place I go to (name that Johnny Depp movie) - enchiladas - and these were a cut above. Meats were juicy without being runny or greasy.	I love this place but went today and they were closed. So note that they are no longer open on Sunday. But go the other 6 days. The pickled carrots that come with the chips and salsa are great. Food and Margs are as well.	The BEST Mexican food around. The service is great. They have awesome Mole and all the food is very high quality. They take a lot of pride in what they do. You should definitely try it. We have been going there for years.	This place is amazing! Quality ingredients and the best service in town. Oscar is the greatest server!!! Delish chips and salsa! The food is amazing, the Burrito Tropical with grilled chicken is to die for!! mmhmm	I'm a big fan of the guacamole at Casa Del Sol. They told me the make it fresh and I enjoy it. My boyfriend and I go fairly often and we love the endless chips and salsa (probably too much) and we like the entrees too. The service is always top notch.	I dont get the reviews? i tried this place twice in the last couple weeks and the food was ok at best. i sat in bar area both times and they seem to run short staffed as it took a while to be served and get refills both times. they do seem very friendly once they get to you.	We eat here every chance we get. We live about 30 minutes away, but we still get there every week or two. I love this place... the food is excellent and the manager is a sweetheart. The cheese enchiladas.... yeah... get those. Also, the specials are always great! My favorite restaurant since moving to Wisconsin!	My favorite for Mexican in the Madison area, especially in the summer when you can sit outside on the deck. I've never had a bad meal here, and whatever the 'special of the day' is- order it. It's usually very good.	This is the best Mexican food around. They have an amazing mole and all the food are of very high quality. The grilled chicken with Burrito Tropical is awesome. the specials are great and the service is amazing. But they do seem to run short of staff. Overall this place is amazing.	This Mexican restaurant has great food and excellent service. The food, especially the enchiladas, is nearly universally good. The specials also come highly recommended, and they have unlimited chips and salsa. The service is very friendly and generally fast. This restaurant is highly recommended for lovers of Mexican food.	This is a very good Mexican restaurant. The quality of the food is excellent and the endless chips and salsa are very satisfying. Service is always top notch and the drinks on the table are never empty. They definitely take pride in everything they do.
business	REM8BezFuK4MQ6j2k1I7-Q	This place has changed to Stacks and Yolks so we decided to give it another try. What a change!!! Food was great. Service was great. Food was a little slow coming out because there was a car show but worth the wait. Definitely worth another look if you've been to previous restaurant.	Arrived at 9: 50 am on a Sunday morning.... Seated rather quickly, then waited over an HOUR before our food came. The wait is not worth it, especially when you have kids. Avoid this restaurant on a weekend.	This place has good food, not great but good. The decor is outdated and needs a good cleaning but i guess it can be good if you're looking for an old fashion diner.Customer service is great and they get your food to you extremely fast.	I have had breakfast here a couple times now. It's always busy weekend mornings, the customer service is always very good, however their food isn't all that impressionable. My oatmeal was missing some of the ingredients that it was supposed to have and their skillet ingredients aren't fresh. You're better off going home and making the stuff yourself.	Pass on this place. Food was ok, nothing special. Service was bad. When you have to continually go to the counter to ask for things it kinda puts a damper on the dining experience. Won't be going back.	Walked in, it was nice and clean. Silverware was spotless the waitress was nice but kinda of slow on attending to us. Finally the lady at register noticed we were ready and approached us and took our order. The food was great and the drinks were great as well! Very 'Moms & Pops' type of place! Loved it	Not bad for a little Hole in the wall breakfast diner! I had the pancakes which by the way are huge, fluffy, and delicious. Turkey sausage had good flavor. The homeFries are decent. And the scrambled eggs were made just right. Good service by the waitress. I would recommend this place to any person wanting breakfast.	ok place I feel for what you get its a little pricey orange juice it's good but for sure its not fresh squeeze it has like a very weird sweet good flavor but I am sure it's not squeeze I don't think I'll be back	This is a small mom-and-pop diner-style restaurant. The food is adequate, though generally not outstanding. The service is sometimes slow, even very slow. It has the classic diner feel. It's not recommended as a special trip, but can be fine for those in the area who don't mind having wait.	This is a good breakfast place to eat, but it can get very busy. The customer service is friendly, however at times the food can take a long time to get to the table. The food isn't amazing but it's good and it's a nice breakfast diner to enjoy a meal out.	Stacks and Yolks is a nice, homely diner. Everything is good, but nothing is great. All the typical staple diner foods is here, from pancakes, eggs, sausages, fries, oatmeal, OJ, etc. It's all cooked exactly how it needs to be with nothing fancy added to it. The service can be slow, though the servers are friendly.
business	RRpHuoXpxcuLk4LdB_YrOg	I just want to say thank you to all the staff for their help and especially to Jarred. He went above and beyond to answer all the questions I had and he gave me more information then I even expected to need. Because of his customer service not only will I be returning but this is the only place I will come to make any purchases.	The shooting range at DFA is large, and although fairly busy I have never had to wait for a lane. The staff is friendly. Prices are reasonable (get a frequent guest card to earn free range time). If in the market for a firearm, they have the largest selection I've witnessed in Vegas.	Went in on our anniversary to get the hubby a left handed rifle for his upcoming hunting trip. The lady behind the counter laughed and said that we had her at left handed - suggested my husband learn to shoot right handed. So disappointed. So much for being a credible gun dealer.	Been coming here for years. $10 to get on the range. Bring your own ammo. I'm sure there are rules about shooting reloads or steel core but I don't use that junk so I really couldn't tell you.	They have shuttle service to varies resorts to pick you up. The driver was very friendly and able to discuss guns at length. 'Little John' a range safety officer helped us and did the range work with us. We shot an AK-47 and the M-4. John was very knowledgeable, friendly and eager to help us have an awesome experience.	Ok so this place came recommended by a coworker! But after standing in front of the counter and having two employees behind the counter look at me and ignore me and another to then walk right by me and say nothing just to walk over and start a conversation with the other two employees that is not customer service! Guess I will take my business elsewhere!	Called to ask about availability of magazines. Unhelpful response = don't have them, on order but no idea when they will arrive. Did not offer to take an order or call when stocked. No effort made to be courteous.	Went to Discount Firearms and they taught our group valuable gun safety and then we shot awesome machine guns. It's was really cool. Joe (owner) was there and was making sure we were having a great time and Zach (firearm instructor) was very helpful and knowledgeable. All in all a great place to go!	The behind the counter workers make little to no effort to accommodate a customer's needs looking to make a purchase at this shop.  It does have good reasonably priced gun range, complete with helpful and friendly instructors. If a customer is looking to have fun and just shoot some guns this place is highly recommended, if they are looking to make a purchase they may want to look elsewhere.	Discount Firearms is a firearm trader with their own shooting range and shuttle service. Most of the staff are knowledgeable, friendly and competent, they guide and educate customers, which makes for a generally great customer service. Ammunition is, however, not readily available, which may be a problem for some potential customers. Overall, recommended.	Discount Firearms offers firearms and shooting range experiences at reasonable prices. The majority of the staff are knowledgeable and helpful. There have been complaints of below par customer service. The location is often busy but not overcrowded. Overall, it is recommended.
business	RqOgBMpKYdsEOmBVmFXe3g	Atmosphere: located on the famous baldwin street, modern, trendyFood: cold noodles special, 3 / 5, the noodles were legit cold. which was unexpectedly different. definitely different approach to ramen.Overall: probably wont be back, ill rather go to kinton down the road.	This was my first time trying ramen in the city, and it was a fabulous first experience. I have yet to try anything that lived up to this place. The food was delicious and filling, and the service impeccable. Will definitely be back, many many times.	Ryus owner is Japanese and it shows. I tried other ramen restaurants in Toronto but some others are NOT Japanese. These other restaurants do not serve the Japanese style. Please try Ryus Miso ramen. That is real Japanese ramen!!! I love it!!!	One of my favourite ramen places. Broth is so flavourful and when they say spicy, it's spicy. Not the watered down Canadian level of spicy. The service is excellent and free refills on pop, I'll take it.	I'm glad Ryus reopened after the fire which completely destroyed the Baldwin location. I've always been a loyal follower because of their unique broth and the non traditional toppings they use. Plus their menu is very vegetarian friendly. Service is efficient and attentive. This new locale is across from the Broadview station with lots of street parking.	Absolutely outstanding Ramen. Pork blaster 'hot' has to be a personal favourite. Very filling and rich broth and the spice was good enough to excite my Indian palate... That's really saying something! Will definitely return although I can't say I'd try much else since I'm sold on this one dish. Patio is highly recommended!	I had the vegetarian bowl! Yummy, just right for me.. I prefer it to Kinton's veg. bowl. I really like the atmosphere! Service was very nice and attentive, was a great meal to have with some out of town friends. Ps....... Bathrooms are really cool. Toilet seats are heated. Crazy.	It's hard to compete with 'Kinton' a few shops down, but with their prices and original / delicious broths, they are in contention. It's a nice place to go for cheap, fast, and feeling Ramen. They let you choose which oil / sauce you want on the side which is neat.	The menu is vegetarian friendly. Attentive and efficient service. Very unique broth and the toppings are non traditional. The food was amazing and the filling impeccable. The ramen is absolutely outstanding. The bathrooms are cool and the toilet seats are heated.	The food is delicious, and filling; the service is impeccable. The atmosphere is superb, and prices of the food is cheap. Also, there menu is vegetarian friendly.	There are other popular ramen restaurants in the area, but this one is truly authentic. The owner is Japanese and although there are a lot of traditional dishes on the menu, there are also some unique sauces, oils, etc., used, as well. The broths are fantastic and there's plenty of spice to accommodate the most adventurous palate.
business	ST_MJ4xq1GYSoc3LfgMFnQ	We stopped in for our first visit after a movie nearby. We got chocolate dipped Rice Krispies and marshmallows for the kids and some raspberry jelly chocolates for the ride home! Everything looked and smelled great and everyone was really friendly! We'll definitely be back to try more!	Had a delicious limited edition salted caramel ice cream Saturday evening. It was a vanilla ice cream with a gooey salted caramel sauce and chocolate covered caramel chunks. Yum! They also have caramel apples, house made fudge blocks, toffee, everything you would expect.Service was great and they were very willing to help you sample anything and patient through the decision process.:)	Outstanding! All of my visits have been wonderful. The variety and the quality of their treats are exceptional. I love the location and their customer service is unmatched! Rosa is very friendly and courteous and they are very active on their social media. I made a special request and they were more than willing to satisfy! Their ice cream is also delicious!	Yes. This place. I don't understand how the other Birkdale ice cream places stay in business. This place is great! Love the 'Kilwin's Tracks.' Worth the wait... when there is a line, staff is efficient & the line always moves quickly.	Can get very crowded, but they are an efficient and quick team. I am also pretty sure everything taste great. Don't walk in wife my wife if you are paying. You will be broke. They have fudge galore and good selection of ice cream.	If you like ice cream, you will like Kilwins. An added bonus, if you order a 'single scoop,' they are kind enough to allow 2 half-scoops! So, if you have trouble deciding, you can split the scoop! That's cool in my book: -)	I love this place! Haven't tried anything other than the ice cream but they never disappoint. The ice cream and the waffle bowls are so fresh. I have a sensitivity to preservatives in dairy. You won't find that here! This is literally the only ice cream I can eat. Kilwins.. please don't ever change!	Terrible service today. The young girl at the counter rang us up for 3 pretzels, our total was over $9. The girls argued with me throughout the entire transaction. It was obviously not rang correctly. Rude service, will not be returning.	Kilwins has a great selection of specialty ice cream, both dairy and non-dairy for those with an intolerance for lactose. They serve a great variety of other high quality treats such as fudge and the customer service is excellent and accommodating.	Kilwins has a variety of desserts and candies, but their most popular offering is the ice cream. Their ice cream is considered among the best in the area. Their other desserts are also excellent. They are often busy, but the staff is very efficient. This shop is very highly recommended.	This place is amazing! It can also get crowded, but the team is efficient and quick. The ice cream never disappoints and the waffle bowls are very fresh. The Kilwins is so cool. Everything looked so good, the aroma was great and everyone was very friendly. The location is perfect and their customer service delivery is unmatched.
business	Tz3lmsFCS1e8rUkXuHW9mw	So I came here today and it was alright but the only problem I had was with the host named marisela she was a very rude bitch who has staring problems lol but yeah that's the only problem I have eating there. Anyways I love the server named arcy I do recommend him to others as he is very nice:))))))	IHOP is IHOP.... so the 2 star rating is not for the nation wide chain, it's for this specific location. This IHOP has really really bad service, food takes a long time to show up, drink refiles never come, and it's not as clean as I would like.	Horrible service we put our name in never got called was skipped and host said he called our name when he never once called our name.... Will not be coming back after 30 min wait and he is telling everyone 10-15 min wait.... As he had already crossed off our name...... Service was horribleDoes Not Deserve 1 Star only gave cause I had to...	i prefer breakfast its plentyful and the price is right, however i sometimes do dinner. i am really not a fan of dinner at ihop. not a lot of selection and the price is higher than i think it should be for an ihop. service is great though, i have been going for years.	On September 13, 2014 we went to this IHOP again. We were seated and given menus but after that we were completely ignored. The server never did come back to take our order and after about 15 minutes of waiting we got up and left the restaurant, unable to even order our food.Extremely poor service.	We had an amazing server. Her name is Kari. She was very pleasant and very attentive to our needs. The food was great too. I will definitely keep coming here for the food but mainly for her and the amazing service that she gives!!	We had an early before workday breakfast here and the food was delicious. Best of all was the warm energetic and friendly service from Jen. At 5am she was bubbly smiling and so pleasant. It truly was a great start to the day. Thank you Jen for a great experience!	I didn't give one star because this if the first time this has happened. We got some pancakes to go / pickup. The cook must have been multitasking a bit too much. Our stack of pancakes were burnt. Not happy when we got home and opened the container....	Customer service is a real problem at this location. Many of the staff members are unfriendly, slow and do not seem to put the customers first. The food is good, with breakfast being the best menu option. However, the wait for food and a table is excessive.	This IHOP has prices and food typical of any IHOP. The food is OK, as are the prices, in general. The main problem is the service. While some individual waitstaff are friendly, other waitstaff and especially management are slow, rude, or disappear entirely. This IHOP is not recommended.	Ihop is Ihop ,it’s not a formal restaurant. The food is reasonably priced but very mediocre. During breakfast time the wait is typically longer. There isn’t a huge selection of food outside of breakfast and service it hit or miss depending on who the server.
business	UFvLouGNq5q3w-0Ud_HP7w	I would call myself a pizza snob having grown up and out with the pizza from Chicago. This place comes pretty darn close to the real thing. If you are a transplanted Chicagoan you'll see how close they come. If you're from anywhere else, this could possibly be the best you've had.	Pretty good. I like the thin crust pizza, comparable to Vito's but better. Hubbys calzone didn't have ricotta, isn't that standard in a calzone? Is it strange they're only open for 5 hrs? I was wanting to pop in for lunch the other day but realized they open at 4pm.	Absolutely the best pizza I have ever eaten! They actually put sauce on the pizza.. with real tomatoes.... had thin flavorful crust... chocked full of the pepperoni, sausage, onion and mushrooms! Yum... moderately priced for all the cheese and toppings.... a must try!	The chicken wings were disappointing. We ordered 5 wings and got 5 chicken nuggets for $6, they were not worth 1.25 a piece. We also ordered an Italian beef. Was not impressed concitering we are from Chicago it doesn't compare. Over all not good for the price.	Wow amazing deep dish pizza!!! The food truck was up in Scottsdale got the deep dish cheese pizza for $5 a slice, it's huge. I wanted to try it before driving over to the Gilbert or Chandler. Amazing taste, it's worth the drive.	Great location with a bar in house. Store is very clean and service is top notch. We ordered two 10 inch pizzas. One butter crust Sears Tower and one deep dish with pineapple. Pizza was fresh, piping hot and melt in your mouth good.My nephew got a huge Caesar salad for $8 and added chicken. We were all happy.	This place never fails to hit the spot! It has always been my husband and I's favorite place for a deep dish pizza and the wings are also one of my favorites. The staff is always friendly and attentive! I would definitely recommend this place.	Pizza Chips were awesome with fresh salsa. I had the house salad with bacon and it was delicious! Staff nice, decor 'gangsta' style. Hope more people find this restaurant -its kinda tucked back in the parking lot next to Subway. We 'll be back.	The quality of the pizza at this pizzeria is some of the best to be found. There's deep dish for $5 and very thin thin-crust pizza, all with fresh and hot ingredients. There is an indoor bar that goes well with the food. Only downside is this restaurant is hard to find and is only open for short time per day.	This pizza shop serves many styles of pizza and also wings and salad. The pizza is very good, especially the deep dish. The other offerings like wings and salads are also generally well-liked. The prices are reasonable. The staff is friendly. Overall, this pizza shop is recommended.	A great location with an in house bar. The store is very neat and service is of top quality. The pizza Chips with fresh salsa was amazing. The chicken wings were not as good as expected. The staff is always attentive and friendly. For all the toppings and cheese, the price is moderate.
business	UJevx59U-bi6fRADCSa7LQ	Huge place. Not a cozy joint. Booked through OpenTable and it worked perfectly.The service was excellent. Attentive and professional the whole way through. Really impressed. The food was creative and the cocktails were very good. My vegetarian partner had a great meal. My salmon was perfectly cooked.Lot of larger parties around us. Seems like a great spot for events.	The experience lived up to its recommendation. The staff were very knowledgeable, the wine selection was great; recommend a lazy cabreze. So goooood! The seabass was a new edition on the menu and did not disappoint.Had the opportunity to meet the head chef and made us feel right at home.	Came here for summerlicious lunch this year.Food: Albacore tuna sashimi- this was decentCold poached wild salmon - both my guest and I thought this dish was very bland Pana cotta - okayMaple + whiskey marinated cheddar - good The service was great, the servers were very friendly.The food is decent. I would recommend coming here for their regular menu	Their Magic Hour special can't be beat. Strong, tasty cocktails for $6 between 4p-9p.Another consistency after many visits is the staff almost completely ignore you. Be prepared to wait up to half an hour for a server, or stand at the bar for 5 minutes until someone notices you.	Dinner here on Saturday, pre-show. Even though I had to send my steak back because it was undercooked I have to compliment the chef as it was very delicious. Also, the charred octopus is fantastic. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends.	Had diner at Luma a few weeks ago. Food (4.5 / 5) - Pork Tenderloin- Muskox Drinks (4 / 5) - Cool Hand Luke- Chocolate Martini- Fairy TaleService (4.5 / 5) Price (3.5 / 5) Ambiance (4 / 5)	This restaurant has great food. It's well decorated and if you are lucky enough to get a window seat you get to face the CN tower and people watch. The food is delicious. Service can be slow though depending on who you get as a server. Overall great atmosphere and a nice place to eat prior to seeing a show.	Made a yelp account to tell you all just how bad the food was at luma. All 8 of us eating different things from the summerlicous menu were completely dissatisfied with our meals. Bland tasting beef to over salty chicken, and mediocre chocolate whatever it was called for dessert. Avoid wasting ur summer at luma.	Great views, ambiance and cocktails. However, the wait time can often be longer than average and with a few excellent dishes the food in general tends to be bland and not worth the price. While large parties are welcome the lack of customer service and long waits make for a less than enjoyable experience.	The selection of wine and cocktails here is great. The Chef makes creative dishes that taste great, and will remake something when there is a problem. The staff are knowledgeable, professional and friendly but the service can be slow. This is a big restaurant that's good for events, unique dishes and drinks.	The experience actually lived up to its recommendation. knowledgeable staff and a great wine selection. Tasty, strong cocktails and the magic hour special is unbeatable.  The food is very decent and salmon was cooked perfectly. Huge place, well decorated, but not a cozy joint.
business	UpEVdq_euH-5mqCIgUAd2Q	Winterlicious 2016 - food was delicious:) One of Toronto's oldest restaurants I was told. Had the choice to upgrade to their classic french onion soup (which did not disappoint) for a starter, the mushroom medallions for my entree, and the pouding chomeur for dessert - didn't go wrong with these choices.	I haven't been to Le Papillon in years and was and drawn to their patio on Front St. The brunch menu was mediocre, delicate (as in small serving size) dishes and wasn't cheap, $30 / head inc. tax and tip. I've had better and won't be back for a while.	Lorsque la France vous manque rien de tel qu'un petit tour au restaurant Le Papillon, j'ai testé! Et j'ai adoré retrouver les crêpes de France dans un cadre chaleureux, des serveurs très aimables et heureux de faire partager leur passion pour la cuisine française!	I came here with some friends and found the service to be nothing special. The beef bourguignon crepe was fine, but not amazing either. My friends felt similarly about their dishes, as well. Bottom line is that it's good, but there are better places to go for the price point that would offer better flavours and dishes.	Winterlicous tonight. For $25 / person you won't go wrong. We had lamb shank and duck breast. Portion not huge but you get appetizer, main dish, and desert. Environment is what you expected in a class A French restaurant. And it is casual so you don't have to wear tux.	Beautiful decor with very attentive staff. Surprisingly large portion as not typical for French restaurants. We had beef bourguignon and crepe of the day and two soups - all very tasty. I might call it tourist French as I didn't see fancy French sauces or complicated dishes	Brought Mom out for a birthday dinner tonight and it was a real treat. Three words. French onion soup. That, fish and a few choices from the aperitif menu. Soft music and a very pleasant French speaking server. Bravo!	Food was dreadful: both the onion soup and the béchamel seemed to have cornstarch as the primary ingredient. Thick and goopy, not much flavour. Even the coffee was crummy. Service was quick and fine. Once upon a time this was a decent French resto. Those days are long gone.	Le Papillon is a French restaurant that is generally well-regarded. The food is pretty good, though some might find it expensive for the quality. The service is also good, and the atmosphere reminds one of a real restaurant in France. The price may seem a little high to some, but it is otherwise recommended.	French restaurant that offers some dishes though not many French specials. Staff is friendly and includes a French-speaking server. Food quality is average and the environment is pleasant. Overall a good place to dine.	The food was average at best and the services lacked that personal touch one expects at a restaurant of this status. The French onion soup is the star of the menu. Overall an upscale restaurant that is decent, not overly expensive, and pleasant with a beautiful French décor.
business	UsJYr7l0fOaQZG223BbpeA	Great food and service. Been there twice and loved it all. Atmosphere, service, food presentation and special service. We wanted to check out Modern Margarita next door but my grandson wanted their cookie in a pan, so James our waiter offered to send it over for him. Thanks James above and beyond!!!	Came here for a date night and happy hour. Place was pretty empty but quickly filled. Had the Med Plate for appetizer. Pizza for main and gelato for desert. Drinks are fantastic and if you are Lucy you will have Todd as the bartender. Great service and personality. Definitely will be back. Great addition to downtown Chandler.	Went in a Sunday with our family of 4. A large party was seated at the same time. There were no other guests so it was surprising on how long it took for someone to take our order. Food was below average. Service was too.	Pesto chicken pizza is a must!! You won't regret it! Also had the fried calamari comes with a lemon sauce delicious!! My kids also had a cheese pizza and that was really good to. I will definitely be back! The Decour is super cute too	Love this place, the food is excellent, so much better than the Tempe location. I also like the chill atmosphere much better than it's predecessor. Friendly staff, good drink specials, can't go wrong with their pizzas or appetizers. Porco pizza is life	Went with a crowd, was planned ahead. Several people ordered calzones. They were served burnt. Pizza was over cooked. Chicken was under cooked. Meals took way to long to come out. Deserts took 25 minutes. I won't go back.	Very good Margarite pizza and Calzone selection. The heirloom tomato and beet salad was a delicate blend of flavors with the balsamic vinagarette. Get the dressing 'on the side'. Very nice property, decor, ambience and great location. Gotta say... way nicer than 'Crust' across the street. Quieter, better service and selection.	Malcom made my family's experience here great. He offered some great cocktail recommendations and was able to answer all of my questions regarding the food. We felt like we were his only table, with the level of service he was able to give us, though we could see that we weren't. We will definitely be back!	The food is usually great, but the service can be hit or miss. Sometimes, the bartender will offer drink ideas and the staff is attentive, but other times, patrons wait a while for service. The decor is really cute. There is a lot of pizza and calzone options, which tend to be the most popular ordered items here. Salads can be heavy on the dressing, so best to order that on the side. The calamari is great for an appetizer, too. The establishment is also kid-friendly.	Super chill and laid-back atmosphere with a great beer selection. The menu is full of great options besides pizza. The wait staff is knowable and about all the food items.  The Pizza is delicious with an excellent blend of herbs and spices. The only downside is the wait time and service can be slow when they are busy.	This restaurant is generally well-liked. The food is overall very good. The service is also generally good, though may be slow at times. The staff is friendly and accommodating and gives good recommendations on the food and drinks. The atmosphere is also very nice. Overall, this restaurant is recommended.
business	UuO28w986H0CO_HJluQmew	We have thoroughly enjoyed working with Austin, as he has helped us understand OnQ's management process. We are considering renting out our home and will absolutely use OnQ when we are ready! Thank you for the great experience thus far!	When searching for new digs, it doesn't get much worse than a property management company that never responds, despite your multiple communication efforts, persistence and patience. Zero responsiveness is a red flag to be taken seriously. Score of 'FAILED' to On Q.	I was referred to On Q by a friend who rented through them before... I called in, saw the house and was approved to move-in within 2 days... so far so good! Impressed with the process and quickness compared to where I rented before	We are renting a home from On Q. Ryan Haueter, our Property Manager, has been awesome!! He response time to several requests has been almost immediate. He is polite, accommodating and so easy to work with. Thank you Ryan!!	On Q Property management has been quick to respond to our maintenance requests. I appreciate the fact that I can call and actually speak with someone as opposed to sending an email. They have been professional and friendly and made the original rental process an easy one.	Just leased a house with OnQ and everything has been so fast, east, and awesome. Been working with Kim. She is very friendly, fun, and efficient. The office is in a good location, very clean, and modern. Lease signing is done electronically which is very convenient and payments can be made online! Very excited to work with OnQ	We have thoroughly enjoyed working with Austin, as he has helped us understand OnQ's management process. We are considering renting out our home and will absolutely use OnQ when we are ready! Thank you for the great experience thus far!	I wanted to share my experience with On QThe transaction went smooth as butter thanks to Tanner Lee. Tanner is on top of his game. He made our transaction very easy. Tanner has gone above and beyond for us in our new home. I look forward to working with On Q in the months to come. Keep up the good work!!	OnQ has a variety of employees who will work with customers to help with property rental and leasing.  These employees are very friendly and professional, and can help customers get through the process of renting or leasing property very quickly and hassle free. This place is highly recommended.	OnQ is a professional, rental service that makes the process smooth and easy. They are easy to work with and available on demand. There has been some response problems, but that may depend on the representative. Ask for Austin, Tanner or Kim for a great experience. Recommended with only a slight caution.	OnQ Property Management has efficient staff which makes for timely and professional responses to customers' requests. They are remarkably fast in the delivery of their services, and they use methods that optimize convenience e.g. online payment methods, electronic signing, etc. Overall recommended.
business	VVeT1XqQYwrB_fbp3efdUg	I was really impressed. I had lunch there today and thoroughly enjoyed it. The bun, bratwurst, homemade sweet potatoes fries and tea were delicious. The couple beside me got their potato bacon soup and they said it was very good. I'm taking my husband next time. The service was prompt and courteous.	We are from Chicago (both Southside and Northside) and this place gets it.... the Italian beef was juicy on fresh bread with perfect giardinera and the Chicago-style dog hit the mark. We felt like we were back home. The servers are super-friendly too. We will make the drive up here again soon!	Cashier was very friendly and helpful when ordering from their menu since this was my first time up here. I ordered the # 4 which was the two corn dog combo with fries. Corn dogs were good but the fries not so much.	This place could not be more perfect for a native Chicagoan- I may never have to go home again! Seriously Matt's Chicago dog you are the most irreplaceable place in all of Charlotte... Hit this up for a real Chicago dog!	One of my wife's and my favorite places to eat in Cornelius. My wife always gets the Matt Chicago style dog with all the peppers that come on it. I love their reuben. They have homemade potato chips and fries that are delicious, especially if you get a side of ranch for dipping.	First visit. Had the jumbo char dog with slaw, grilled onions, and mustard. Excellent. The dog was very good. The slaw was just right, but the onions were Luke warm. Atmosphere is good with varied seating options and several tv's. I'll definitely make another trip to this place.	I got the chicken philly and that was hands down awesome. I have heard nothing bad about anything on the menu. The staff is awesome and friendly and the place always has customers. The great food is why they always have people here.	Best Chicago Dogs in the Charlotte area -- authentic dogs, italian beef, and more! Pretty much everything on the menu is good -- deli sandwiches, salads, hamburgers, etc. Try the chips with ranch dipping sauce as a side!	This place is more perfect for a native Chicagoan. In Charlotte area, this is the best Chicago dogs. Almost everything on the menu is awesome. The bratwurst, bun, tea and homemade sweet potatoes fries are delicious. On fresh bread, the Italian beef was juicy. The Cashier was very helpful and friendly.	This restaurant serves high quality, fresh and authentic Chicago style fare. The menu offers a number of classic choices such as hot dogs, sandwiches, salads and Chicago-style favorites. The staff provides prompt, friendly service. Homemade potato chips & fries are delicious, particularly alongside ranch dipping sauce. Occasionally, items are served at a less desirable temperature and the fries are occasionally sub-par.  This spot is popular among locals and visitors.	This restaurants excels at making delicious foods native to Chicago. The Chicago Dogs, Philly Cheeseseaks, fries and sandwiches are made with and ingredients that stand out. The customer service is fantastic. All needs are taken care of.
business	VgGO13Fx7dQj4zg3IuVDLw	Blue Moon is a neighborhood bar that makes great burgers and cheese curds. Portions are large and good for sharing.The decor is a little dated, but that isn't the reason to go. They only take cash, but at least there is an ATM in the building.	This place has a lot of character, great beer and excellent food. I had one of if not the best Reuben ever. The food is home made. The clam chowder has real clams and thankfully, they were not rubbery but rather cooked to perfection. I highly recommend Blue Moon Bar & Grill when in Madison, WI.	Definitely a mixed crowd as stated before. Decent food, a nice place to watch the game that is on that day. Not a place where I am a regular, but there seem to be the same faces every time I walk by... weird. 2 stars.	Awesome beer but Veggie burger tastes nasty. A hint of curry, thyme, not sure here but kinda strange and Not a good experience. 1 of 5 stars. At most. A few years ago ur veggie burger rocked!! Please change ur recipe back. Ill be back then!	Love this place. Great burgers, better cheese curds! Great place to watch the game or bring family visiting from out of town. Great bar atmosphere to enjoy every moment you are here. Minus 1 star only because they dont accept credit / debit cards. They do have an atm inside though.	Its a Wisconsin bar. Lighting is pretty bad, space isn't that comfortable but the beer and bar food get the job done, I guess. Service is... well, its a bar. Burger is ok but definitely NOT worth the hype. The whole place could use an update.	This place is a hidden gem!!!! Their clam chowder is to die for!!!!! It could be served anywhere in Boston!!!!! Try a Brat!!!! Top notch!!	Food is fine and beer is pretty standard. Atmosphere - eh. Cash only is pretty annoying. Waitstaff just doesn't really seem to care the twice I've visited. I'm sure they do just fine with their regular crowd. Good for them. I pass.	The Blue Moon Bar and Grill is a typical bar with decent atmosphere. Come for the beer as it's great, but watch out for of the items on the menu. Generally, the burgers are good, but the veggie burger doesn't taste as good as it used. Definitely try the Reuben, though.	The portion size is large and the beer is good. Cash only service for all items. The décor is dated and aged. Overall, the experience is fairly average for a bar, including ambiance and food. Their burgers are the high point of the bar, along with their cheese curd choices.	Bugers and beer are the best features of this bar. While the beer selection is awesome and the burgers are tasty, the bar lacks anything fancy. Dimly lit, dated decor and average service make this bar typical. Overall, it's fun place to grab a beer and watch the game. Cash is a must, as it is the only form of payment accepted.
business	ZqmUmrXkwihgPFjMCYh_Mg	Great place for Indian food. When most of the Indian restaurants are serving medicre food, Paradise has really stepped up their game. Awesome taste, great portions. I went in with my family and had a great exp. And have been regular every week (the lady at front desk would vouch for it:)).	Service was great, authentic food from India but a little to authentic with the no ice. I respect the cultural reasons but in AZ summer cold ice water is a necessity. Food was delicious & you can tell they are very popular within their own community with the amount of take out orders... tons!	Worst place to order food... they say order will be ready in 20 mins and they keep you waiting for more than an hourWorst Service experience and there is no place to sit.Hope they realize how worst is their service and at least try to empathize with people who are waiting in queue	One thing that I always missed in Phoenix (since I moved here in 2015) was a good biriyani place. I came to know about this place last year and I must say it's the best biriyani I had in Phoenix till now. My personal favorites are paradise special chicken biriyani and goat biriyani.	Prompt service and really tasty food. I've had the weekend combo special which has biryani, fried rice, a cup of dessert, 2 appatizers, 1 curry and also one naan. It was a big portion and biryani was full of flavor although not the best I've had.	Reasonable to mediocre food but extremely slow and inaccurate service. Ordered a dosa along with other non veg items. Butter chicken came with slivers of what tasted like tandoori chicken. Dosa arrived so late - the rest of the food was already consumed by the rest of the party. Sambhar arrived cold. Management needs to hire additional help, and train them better.	I wish I could give this restaurant zero stars. The people who work here actively discriminate against LGBTQ customers. When same-sex couples go into this restaurant, they will seat you, give you attitude, and then proceed to tell you that everything on the menu is 'out' .Yeah, they will never see my face or a dime of my money.	Worst Service after being in restaurant after 30 mins also no one came to take order, we had to leave and had to goto different restaurant also they had seated us in table after they asked us to change the table because more people came.	This Indian restaurant is known for serving generally good food and their biriyani dishes are especially popular. The service itself is hit or miss, and there is often a long wait for food. There have been complaints that the staff are not LGBT-friendly. Overall this restaurant is popular in the community and has tasty food, but the service is unreliable.	Service can be average to poor in quality. Take-out orders are a popular option. The food is very flavorful, but may take a while to reach the customer. Ice for a drink is not available, and a place to sit while waiting for a table or take-out order is not offered.	Service at this Indian restaurant is very slow.  Customers will often be kept waiting an excessive amount of time either to order their food, or waiting to get it after the order has been placed. The place does have solid, authentic, Indian style food at least, once it arrives.  Overall this place is not recommended, due to the poor service.
business	a48qF4Tjwooc0GYNPzipNg	Tried them twice, they can't cook an egg to save a life. Wait time is always long, food came out cold. Bummer too because it's so close to home and really the only breakfast place close by. I really wanted them to be better.	Coming from LA, this place disappointed me because it claimed to be healthy yet gourmet but really was just boring. The avocado toast is on sliced storebought bread. The multigrain pancake was nothing to remember. The house coffee is watered down. Maybe we ordered the wrong items but it really was a forgettable experience.	Great food, great atmosphere. Has a patio to enjoy the outdoors. Staff is always friendly. They offer free coffee and infused water while you wait. The menu is extensive with plenty of healthy options as well. Parking is easy. The only complaint is that the wait is sometimes really long, but thats because it's popular.	We have came twice within the last two weeks and food was good. Fresh and tasty! My kids love the chocolate chip pancakes. The potatoes are my favorite! Staff is friendly and attentive. Inside is clean and very modern. They also have outside patio seating that will be nice once the temperature cools down.	I'll be honest, I'm really sick of the faux local cafes. We won't be back. The food is overpriced for the quality, my omelet had about three sprinkles of chorizo, and the potatoes were uninteresting. Coffee is cheaper at Starbucks. Upsides- Our waitress was very good and the millionaire's bacon was tasty.	It's was pretty cold in here. The morning juiced beet juice was absolutely delicious. The menu had a variety of healthy meals. I was pretty impressed. I had lemon risotto blueberry pancakes. This was the best pancakes I've had. The flava just popped in my mouth. I will be back to try something different.	Good food & service. Usually crazy busy on the weekends!! A must here for us is their lemon ricotta pancakes, they taste better than they sound I promise!! I also like that they have complimentary coffee & ice water while you wait to be seated.	I've eaten here before when it was The Good Egg but am LOVING the First Watch changes. The manager came over to greet me personally and my server (Desmond) was polite, knowledgeable of the new menu and offered an excellent suggestion to my normal favorite. I tried the healthy egg white omelette w / spinach, feta cheese and sli	This is a breakfast restaurant that specializes in healthier breakfast food. The service is very friendly and knowledgeable. The food is generally good, especially the pancakes. It is busy at times, so wait times are sometimes long. This restaurant is recommended for people who want a healthier, more gourmet-style meal compared to a typical breakfast restaurant.	This is a local cafe that excels at customer service, though the wait can be long. To compensate, there is complimentary free coffee and infused, ice water. There is a patio outside that adds to the ambiance. The food is hit or miss being that it is not upscale. The lemon ricotta pancakes is the best dish.	Great food and atmosphere. They offer free infused water and coffee during waiting time. The menu had lots of healthy meals. The food is very good. The pancakes are amazing and the morning juiced beet was delicious.  The Staff is attentive and friendly.
business	avTIDv9lJHiNcg3mcwTxqg	Pretty decent food. Ordered the Irish spring roll. French onion soup was really good! Rebye was pretty good, but battered chicken fingers and fries are not as good as expected (you'd be better off with Chick Filet and Bojangles for sure). Great service and extensive desert menu. Will definitely come back to try more on the menu.	The atmosphere was outdated and old. The food was cold. We had the onion soup which was tasty, but our main meal was sub par. The Ruben was underwhelming and the burger was dry. The wait staff was friendly and eager to serve. Unfortunately we won't be back.	What a gem. We came into town for a trip to Carowinds the next day. We found this place on yelp. This is what I love about yelp. We would have never found this place or given it a chance. Great pizza and everything we had was fantastic. Great service and great food. Well done.	Decided to try Trios while in town for my daughters soccer tournament and it did not disappoint! The food was delicious! The Trio sampler was the perfect combo of salad, fruit and chicken salad and the key lime pie was nothing short of amazing!	We went here for Restaurant Week and it was yuck, just yuck. The salads were good, but the decor and the entrees are straight out of the 80's and everything was either overcooked or oversalted. Gordon Ramsay needs to come yank this place out of 'Kitchen Nightmare' status.	I don't know why I keep going back to this place. While talking to my wife about trying to find a home for a pit bull puppy, the manager told her to just have it put to sleep. Nice customer service. What a jerk.	Very consistently delicious food. I've been going here for 15 years and have never been disappointed. The service is good, I go during lunchtime and never seem to have any issue getting in and out with my time constraints. The staff is great and I love chatting with one of the owners, Cutt.	I like the marinara sauce here! I was very impressed. The service is very good. I have been here twice and enjoyed my food each time. I had the pasta special. They have good bread and salad also. I will definitely come back!	The food in this restaurant is generally well-received, though tastes vary. The service and waitstaff are friendly and efficient. The main issue is that the decor and atmosphere is very dated. The restaurant is recommended for those who prefer classic American restaurant staples and don't mind (or prefer) a more old-fashioned atmosphere.	A restaurant that offers some good dishes especially the salads, served by friendly and courteous staff. However, the environment is a bit old-fashioned, and some dishes fall below expectation. Overall moderately-recommended place	The best part about this gem is the waitstaff. They were friendly, on top of things and very knowledgeable of the menu. The French onion soup and Irish spring roll are the stars of the menu. Even with the outdated atmosphere, it’s a great experience with reasonably priced food.
business	av_-ePHJwSSqMtTQbNoL7g	The way this place works is pretty cool. You get a bowl and just stack it with all different types of meat and seafood. The choices were overwhelming but all great. It was interesting to watch them make your creation. For the amount of food you get, the price is good as well. I'll definitely be back.	I was excited to return here and we had such a good dinner. Watching dinner being prepared on the large grill and picking what you want makes this a fun place. Don't forget to hit the gong to thank them! I opted for 2 bowls and also tried some different ingredients. I just really like the large options that are available.	This restaurant is barely worthy of one star. They leave raw food sit out on a buffet. They have a very large disk where they attempt to cook your food. Mine wasn't fully cooked and I got food poisoning. I'm never coming back EVER.	I like it, the food tastes good, and it's a cool concept.But they're not very clear on what to do and where to go to with the plates. And it's not very clear how much stuff costs, like is a side of rice included?	The food was decent but the overall experience is not. The process of creating your bowl is not fun and is very difficult to manage if you have small children in tow. The place was also a mess with virtually every point being point being dirty. We have no intention of ever returning again.	Our server was extremely rude. She was slamming utensils and rolling her eyes constantly. No greetings and was not tentative. We felt like we were not welcome and were rushed.The food is overpriced and we got egg shells in our meal.It was so bad that I created this Yelp account to give this review.	I would recommend this to anyone. The food is great... well if you know what you are doing (build your own bowl). Endless food is on $2 more than the standard price. Come hungry and eat well.	Great food. Great service. The grill master was fantastic. They were great about keeping up with the lunchtime rush too. I will be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh. Prices are also good. Unlimited stir fry for 12.99!	The food at this location is, for the most part, of good quality although it may have been sitting out for a while.  The staff is above average with service and there is some confusion to how to actually create a dish to eat.	Customers in this stir-fry restaurant pick their ingredients buffet style, then the cook prepares the meal in front of them. The process can be confusing and chaotic for some, especially small children. Overall, the food is good, however, sometimes there is a mess in the food station. This is recommended for people who want a unique experience.	While the concept is unique and the food—when cooked correctly—can be good, the overall dining experience is highly disappointing.  The service is rushed and unprofessional, the cooking area is messy and unsanitary, and building the entree bowls can be confusing. However, they do offer unlimited food options for only a few dollars extra.
business	bCrMHwCLZzyKsAUOiAL0OA	3 stars for the garlic knots.I've had better, they were kinda doughey, but the garlic and butter flavor was good and you get a generous tub of marinara too. I think I'll stick to the pizza, the slices are PERFECT.	I won't get too verbose about the food. I will merely say this: it's the best pizza I've ever eaten, period. I don't know what makes it different from the other New York-style pizza-by-the-slice joints around town, but it's head and shoulders above anything I've had in the valley.	My guys love love this pizza... They say it's the best combo of cheese and crisp of the crust.I did try the wings and just not a fan, but if you want great pizza then you'll love it here.I came back and had the 10 'gluten free pepperoni pizza and it was awesome! Best Gf pizza I've had!	A very nice pizza. I haven't made up my mind which is more authentic, NYPD or Ray's. Both, have the thin NY style crust, but NYPD makes me feel like I'm waiting for an E train to Queens; whereas Ray's feels more upper east side-ish.	Place has been on a slide last few years. Loved the food when they first opened. As a NY transplant I was happy to have Ray's nearby. Disappointing crust had a cardboard texture. So little sauce that the pizza was dry. Cheese not fully melted. The crust ends were skinny and poorly formed. Slightly better than frozen supermarket pizza.	Not a fan, not even a little bit. Underwhelmed by the overall taste and the sauce on the slice, which I think is the most significant ingredient was bland. Not likely to give Ray a chance to make a second impression.	Yummy pizza! Every time I got they are super nice and the pizza is delicious. I order a pie to go- so I haven't tried the pizza by the slice. Oh and don't forget wings, they are great too!	I overheard and watched the owner being very rude a customer who asked about gluten-free customer say that and his place he's the boss here and he'll do the things he wants and he doesn't want to here about gluten free pizza.	This place serves delicious New York style pizza. They offer both pies to-go and the classic pizza by the slice. Both options taste great for fans of the thin, crisp New York style crust. The staff are also very nice. The other menu dishes are ok, but pizza is the specialty here.	The place has good food, gluten free pepperoni pizza, the overall taste and the sauce on the slice is good. A place different from the other New York style pizza by the slice joints around town.	The service at Ray's is decent but has had complaints in the past. The food is inconsistent and switches between a high quality pizza pie to a lower almost uneatable pie and the sides tend towards being bland to okay at best.
business	bGaMzx2PcwzhYBX9Gn7_hg	We've been here several times before, and it's always been okay-maybe a little less. We went today, and it was really good. The entire restaurant was cleaner, and the food was very tasty, much better than before. I'd definitely recommend it.	This is my favorite mexican restaurant the food is more on the traditional mexican style. They are the perfect combination of flavors and textures, cheap and excellent food. I'm extremely picky about Mexican food and this place is the only one I've ever been for real Mexican food.	I have been living in NC for 8 years and this is the best Mexican food I've had since moving here. Food was great. Had a shrimp dish and everything was cooked to perfection. My wife had a Burrito and that was really good also. This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant.	I have frequently visited this place for dinner over the last 10 years. The quality of food has been great every time. Only concern, it use to be very cheap to eat here however prices have increased over the years to where it's no longer a bargain. Food is still worth the price.	Delicious, affordable and a little nicer than most Mexican restaurants I've been to, but it's still pretty casual. I really like their seafood burrito. It's yummy! It's easy to find (right on the side of Roosevelt) and they have great dips.	This is our first time to eat at this location. We have eaten at the Waxhaw location three separate occasions. The food has been consistently good. We thought we would have to give up good Mexican food when we left Texas. We have been pleasantly surprised. Mucho gusto.	This is without a doubt my favorite mexican resturant in town. The dip is fantastic, the employees are wonderful and you can be in and out in 15 minutes. Everything on the menue is good and it is priced well. Easy 5 Star.	Stopped here for a quick supper and had the carne asado tacos and one grilled chicken taco. The carne tacos were super. Chicken was bland. Beautiful presentation on authentic colorful plates. Bill was $14 and I gave waiter a $20 and he asked if I wanted change. Ummmm yeah so I just paid $20 for three tacos.	This is a good casual Mexican restaurant. The food is overall very good, even for those who are used to more "authentic" Mexican dishes from the Southwest. The service is friendly and fast. The prices are also very reasonable. This is a highly recommended Mexican restaurant.	The food at this Mexican restaurant has been consistently great for many years. The restaurant is very clean.  The employees are friendly and nice. As the restaurant has become more upscale, the price of the food has risen over the years.	This Mexican restaurant offers consistently delicious food at affordable prices. The dishes are served in a traditionally Mexican style. Fast and friendly service can be expected. The inside of the restaurant is clean and nice, yet casual.
business	bMrYaaAy62ppdS09na0RgQ	The pizza I got yesterday was terrible, however they said they would replace it, so I am going now to see how it is. I never had a bad pizza here until yesterday. so, it could have been someone who didn't know what to do.	Ordered once and not impressed. What really turned me off was when I saw their employees drinking at 1: 00 in the afternoon at a local bar just down the street in uniform. I'm not making accusations as they may have been off work, but believe that it's a horrible way to represent your company. Just think it's not very professional	Great pizza place! I had the white pizza and the Chicken Picatta pizza. Both were great. I've also had the Sausage and Broccoli Rabe and the Pepper and Egg sandwiches, both were delicious and the bread was soft and fresh. My favorite thing about this place is that it's only 1 mile from home!	.. what can I say but.. Awesome! Had the chicken Parmesan sandwich, probably the best the best I'll ever have, and the homemade Cannolis... I don't eat a lot of sweets, but wow.. just wow! you gotta try em.	Sad to say they had great pizza at the beginning.. Now cutting corners... Very pricey not worth the money.. We will not be ordering there anymore. It's a shame because we didn't mind the high price for good pizza. But dominos pizza is close and way better and cheaper!!!	First time here introduced by friends. Had the linguini and clams. It is the best lineup I and clams that I had for a long time!!!! Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys this dish. Mike and Matt are really nice and friendly. Great food and service overall. Will definitely be back soon for other items in the future.	Whooooooo they have one of the best Pizza and the service was awesome the location is great I didn't eat pizza like that for long time House of pizza they have a really great prices I will come back again and I do recommend that place to anyone great pizza.......	Being from New Jersey and a huge Yankees fan this place is soo good. Felt like I was back on the west coast. Good prices and even better pizza! I'll definitely be back, glad i found this gem.;) A good environment and the Yankee memorabilia is so bomb.	Mixed reviews for this restaurant about the pizza, ranges from great pizza-delicious, to now cutting corners, not worth high price. The other foods on the menu have much better reviews. Good dishes mentioned were-chicken Parmesan sandwich, homemade cannoli, linguini and clams, and other sandwiches, such as Sausage and Broccoli Rabe, Pepper and Egg.	The pizza is usually good, but it's not always consistent. The linguine and clams are worth trying, and the bread for the sandwiches is always fresh. For dessert, the cannolis can't be beat. However, the prices are on the high side for some of the portions. The staff is usually attentive and friendly, but aren't always as professional as they should be.	This pizza place was a hidden gem. The prices were always low and the quality of the food was even better. It has changed since then. It has turned into a bar more than a restaurant and are cutting corners with the food. They service has always been great! This place is hit or miss it seems depending on the night.
business	chU-VggYf4LpWqEMdbgisQ	My son loves this place! Miss Beth, your gal Mady is exceptional. She has a great attitude, and even if all of southern Nevada was in dire straits, I know that she would still bring a smile to work. Invest in her, and don't let your good people go! -Jake	Absolutely love this place I've been to multiple indoor playground and this by far is my favorite spot for my child .tony the owner is so sweet and Accommodating he helped me with planning and arranging my sons birthday party it was a blast I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and family	This place is awesome! $10 per kid and there's plenty to do for the price. Safe, clean, awesome! I will definitely be coming back here. Wearing three kids out after school is not an easy task but this place is definitely up to the challenge. Thanks!	Specifically for my needs this places is perfect. There is a plentiful seating for parents with deep comfy couches. Several rooms with larger climbing structures for little monkeys. Perfect for active kids. My husband feels it's a little cavey and dark. But our kid loves it.	Great place. Super clean and the staff is always nice. The only frustrating thing is the lack of power outlets. In fact, I think there is onkI try to get some work done while my son plays do it would be great to have a powersource behind a couch or table..	My daughter LOVES this place! Friendly staff, very clean and so much to do. I like the fact that I can bring outside food and the free wifi. I tend to bring work with me and I can knock out hours why she plays and plays and plays!	We had our daughters first birthday party here. We had so much fun playing on all the structures. The host was very helpful and attentive to our needs. We were able to bring our own food for our event and they even gave us a little extra time to setup and cleanup.	Friendly staff, perfect place for kids when you need to escape the heat but they want to play. My son is one and loved it. Very clean also and very affordable. They had a great toddler area, bounce house for older kids and lots of places for them to climb and slide.	This place is great to allow kids to run wild and expend pent-up energy while parents sit in the cool lounge and work on a laptop or read a book.  The variety of equipment to climb on keeps the kids from getting bored - and is kept very clean by the helpful staff.	Great indoor playgrounds for kids, toddlers and up. Friendly staff and the place is very clean.  Lots of comfy seating for the parents  who bring the kids here. Very safe, kids have fun, parents can relax, maybe get some work done.  Host is very accommodating, great for parties and food can be brought from home.	Not only is this place well loved by children, but their parents seem to enjoy it too. It is an indoor playground with climbing structure, and is great for active children. It's the perfect idea for someone who wants to tire out their child, or for when a birthday party needs to be held somewhere. The staff are very friendly and helpful. There is quite a lot to do to keep the children and their families busy while visiting.
business	dsIHIXyAl_ldqkd8QekvTQ	Great patio in the summer, food is just okay. The waitresses are a little dumb and hardly ever come by to check your table. Typical pub, but the main selling point is this place's patio. I wouldn't come here for any other reason.	Great patio, especially for the crowded stretch of King street it's on. The food is just ok, relatively underwhelming pub food. We had the wing special and were surprised how mild their spicy wings were. Good selection of beers on draft and the service is relatively good. I would recommend for patio drinks but do dinner somewhere else.	First time eating here ordered the poutine burger and I was a but skeptial at first but I'm glad I went with my gut feeling because it was amazing a bit sloppy so wouldn't recommend for a first date lol but other then that it was fantastic I'll definetly be returning!	Had the chicken wings. I could have made better at home. Other than the crappy food, the waiter was giving us some attitude and they put us right next to smokers on the patio. Shame because it is a nice patio.	Decent-ish food but bad service. We asked for fish and chips and upon inquiring after 50 min turns out the kitchen never received the order. In turn, they were hardly apologetic. Not going there again, despite the fact their patio is nice. They can really make good business out of it, but they are not interested.	Came here 2 days in a row on a Sunday and Monday. I was staying down the street at the Hyatt. Bathrooms have a pissy smell. Food is good, though. Not many patrons. I'm curious when there busy time is.	Food was okay. Poor service, downright rude waitresses even though the restaurant wasn't full. Wasn't even given forks / knives with the food, and took up to 15 minutes to flag the waitress down who seemed to ignore it at first. Won't be returning to this place. Save your money and go elsewhere.	This is a nice place! Clean and respectable, I went with a friend and my teen son. The food was good very tasty. I was disappointed at the rib. They were good but too small and they looked prepackaged. The waitress was really friendly and attentive. Lots of T.V's was a good thing as we went for super bowl.	This place is clean, and there's a pretty nice patio, which is the main selling point of the venue, but the food and service are not consistent. Sometimes, the servers forget things and can have an attitude and be downright rude. The food is what is expected from a typical pub. There is a fantastic beer selection, including several options on tap.There are also many large televisions for sports.	The main draw of this pub-style restaurant is the patio. It is a good place to sit and have some drinks. The food, however, is mediocre, and the service is just bad, from inattentive to downright rude servers. This is an OK place to have drinks on the patio, but is not recommended at all for the food.	The atmosphere is a typical pub with mediocre food and poor service. Not a great place to eat at, but good for getting beers on draft. The best feature here is the outdoor patio so it's a good place to go for patio drinks, if smokers are not minded.
business	ffA8x9O0jGP5DkpTiT4NcA	Absolutely love it here, I am glad they made the switch to all country. The crowd was beginning to become a little too much. Some of the best staff you can ask for, great bands, and of course d.j. and karaoke. Everything you need for a good night in one place!	Great old bar with historical roots. Good service, great drinks and decent food. Real draw is Friday and Saturday night after ten thirty to eleven, it ceases to be a bar and becomes a local party. Beautiful women frequently dance and need a partner.	This isn't the best or worst. It's just another (better than most). I start by saying. I wanted to check so I called asking 'Do you have Karaoke?' .yes. and yes I know they do. But don't go out there on a hot Saturday-Country-Line-Danceing-Night and expect to sing Karaokie. Not that the alternative is bad.	Solid performance. Good music, drinks and fun! Sometimes it takes a while to get a drink though. The bar is always slammed! There was a guy getting a little to handsey with me and the bouncer checked him right away.:)	Great place.... good music... good service cash only you got to love that... old school country bar.... but they have a DJ that plays dance music all night why drive all the way downtown for a cold beer and good music	This review is solely for their nightlife as I was completely unaware that they serve food other than the hot dog cart outside at 2am.How many places can you say play country in one room and hip hop in the other? I feel it, I feel it. It's a people watching GOLDMINE.	Great burgers. Awesome chili. A little fancy for some. Cash only. For you folks from the upper midwest, this place has a Grain Belt light above one of the tables. I feel like I'm right back in Stearns County when I'm at Roman's. Minus the 99 inches of snow of course.	I absolutely love this bar!! Everyone is so friendly whenever I go there. They have darts, shuffleboard, karaoke, live bands, and dancing. I definitely recommend going here!! The only catch is they only take cash	The bar is well-known for its country music, cold beer, and good food.  Line dancing is offered for those interested, and on occasion a DJ will play modern hip hop music.  The bar is usually busy so come prepared to look for a spot and be surrounded by fellow country-music fans.	An old-fashion bar that specializes in country, and have just switched to playing only all country music. To go along with the old-school attitude is the fact that only cash is accepted as payment. There is karaoke, good food, games, and of course dancing that last all night.	This is a great old country bar with historical roots. The quality of the service is excellent and the staff are all very friendly and professional. There is an on-site DJ, karaoke, live bands and lots of dancing. Great music, good food and ice cold beer all in one place.
