business	gUQXksFGvShjSl7Xil41bQ	Came here to have my IPAD4 cracked screen fixed and they did a fantastic job and at a really affordable price. Definitely worth a try if you have a need to repair you tablet or phone. Will update if there are any problems but they have a 30 day warranty.	I stopped by Mobile Square recently, to replace the battery on my iPhone 6. The staff were professional, knowledgeable, and had the job done in 20 minutes! My phone has been working great. With the 30 day warranty they offer, plus their ridiculously good prices, I couldn't recommend this place enough.	Got my iPhone 6 wet on a run, power button didn't work, volume and home button on the fritz, and the phone kept trying to turn off. $30 and 1 hour later, I'm happily posting this from my phone!	These guys are the biggest crooks known to man. They fixed my screen with an aftermarket part claiming that was an original part. The resolution on my screen was distorted because of this.My touch screen is not glitching after 3 weeks.DO NOT GO TO THEM. THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!	These guys were really quick and professional! Was recommended by a friend. Got my Samsung phone fixed in 30 mins and the price was great and service was attentive. They also threw in a case and protector. Now my phone feels great! Would totally recommend and definitely coming back!	Unreliable liar. Does not honour what their agreed upon quoted price was. I called them twice confirmed the price to replace a glass screen. After coming in, the price was changed on me. Beware. Do not deal with.	Awesome super fast super inexpensive service. I was really impressed. Really professional and nice people. I smashed my iPhone 7 screen to pieces and it came out to $75 after the $5 yelp discount. Pay cash so you don't have to pay tax. 30 day warranty to for any screen response issues. Thanks guys!!!	I took my iPad to change what I thought was a dead battery. But they tested it first to make sure it was running properly without selling me something I didn't need. Very professional. I've used them before also to change my iPad cracked screen and they did a fine job.	Great customer service, tends to the customers' needs very quickly and perform very thorough and fascinating jobs. Some customers might have complaints as 100% perfection is not possible, but all in all, they perform professionally and have one of the cheapest prices available.	The repair service for fixing phones is, generally, professionally done with good customer service. There are a few times Mobile square has stumbled in the past but , overall, their services are good for the customer and reasonably priced.	The staff were professional,  knowledgeable, and had the job done as quickly as possible. Phones are fixed in 30 minutes, prices are great and service was attentive. They were recommended by a friend.
business	gsGxpk5uhy1XvaUSOrWTug	The service at the door was poor. Whoever the door girl is?... get a new one. Shes like the teacher on ferris buller. Server was on point Angel was his name. Above and beyond. Food was not worth the price for sure.	I have been here 20 times and the staff from greater, wait staff, bartenders, managers Have been excellent busy slow always the same great service. Have had orders not made to my request and instantly fixed, mangers always come by asking how everything is. The food is excellent	It's Olive Garden and it's in Surprise, so it's always busy. I've always had decent service and good tasting food. If I have my choice, I'm always going to choose a less chain place, but it's not bad in a pinch.	I'm currently eating a Olive Garden and I can honestly say Trevor, our waiter, is wonderful! He has been making sure that our drinks are full and that everything is tasting great! Definitely coming back because of him! Keep up the great work Trevor!!!!	This location is busy. I was happy with the prompt service and good food. I have visited the other locations in the past 75th McDowell and Estrella parkway and McDowell and this location is by far the the friendliest. Next time I feel like soup and salad without ghetto or cold treatment I will definitely stop at this location.	The host, our waitress and the food were all great! Though they sat us in the back where there was an uncomfortable smell, I usually come here and never have that problem so I'll come back again but yeah, my overall experience was good and i love the soups, the salads and the fettuccine!	I, like I'm sure every other American, love Olive Garden. I haven't experienced anything different about this location compared to another except the wait times. The wait times are almost always 45 minutes minimum and for me it's just not worth it.	We went early on a thursday night. Our party of 4 was seated immediately. Service was fast and we all liked our entries. Everything tasted fine, hot, good portions. Wine was good. I will return, its a decent alternative to Carrabas.	This Olive Garden is always busy because of its location, but despite that, the staff is wonderful and friendly. Expect long wait times when it gets very crowded. This place has great soups and salad, and the wine is excellent as well. The food comes fresh, hot, and in large portions.	Service is fast and the portions are well sized. Customer service is at a high level, with the host, wait staff, bartenders and managers being quick to remedy problems. Orders are fixed quickly to the customers liking if needed. Seating can sometimes take a while depending on the night. Value can be low on some items, but the flavor is usually high.	This particular branch of Olive Garden is usually very busy due to its location and this makes for longer wait times. Food tastes great and is just about as good as at other (Olive Garden) locations, but with friendlier and more impressive staff. Overall great place for a meal if one is not in too much of a hurry.
business	i4hvmTd4RH9HvOyG8ndYGw	I love this neighborhood pizza place. The pizza is yeasty and bubbly crusted; foldable. Amazingly good and fresh ingredients on a saucy cheesy piece of heaven. It is right by home and i could eat here once a week - easy.	Got to try The Raffaele 14 inch Special. The pie has 7 toppings on it. Was baked to perfection with a flavorful marinara sauce that helped to highlight the tastey contrast of the crispy crust. I had a side order of ranch for dipping. Now I look forward to trying Raffaele's Sicilian on my next visit. Till then, CHEERS!!	The Sicilian Sub here is to die for. It's made fresh right when you order. The dough is slightly crispy and soft when you bite into it and you don't want it end! I live in Surprise and still drive out to get this sub!	Great hidden gem. You can order pizza by the slice. Always fresh, the owner made a fresh pie when I ordered 6 slices so it could be fresh. They also have great meatball subs and some of the best mozzarella sticks you can get in Phoenix.	I grew up with Rafaelle's Pizza. One of 2 places from which my family would order. Both places are still in business! The pizza is great and the lunch specials are a fair deal as well! Still consistently great after 30 years!	I really love the Sicilian pizza here. This pizza is perfect for 5-6 people.The New York style pizza here is also very good. You can't beat it in Phoenix. This pizza reminds me of living back East. I don't have a picture. I ate it all.	The best pizza place in the Valley just happens to be the first pizza my wife and I went to when we moved out here almost 11 years ago. The pizza is straightforward and delicious, the wings are sneaky good and the staff is great. If you're in the area, stop in - you won't regret it!	Soooooo good.. the guys there friendly as anyone and the food is awesome... this is the type of place I envision taking up a corner in Brooklyn... a little shady but that pie is amazing!!!! Very good guys... will be back!!!!	By far the hidden gem with the best pizza and authentic NYC flavor and feel. Laid back atmosphere that is comfortable without being pretentious. The quality of the pizza and ingredients is always top notch! They have a large menu with several appetizers and subs that do not disappoint.	This pizza restaurant has been around for decades, and continues to be as well-recommended as it always has. The pizza is what they're best known for, but the subs and everything else they serve are also highly regarded,  The staff is friendly and do a good job.	The best pizza place in Phoenix.The pizza is perfection, with a crispy crust, delicious sauce and plenty of cheese. Pizza is sold either as a whole pie or by the slice. Wings, mozzarella sticks and subs are also on the menu as just as tasty at the pizza. With a friendly staff this top notch neighborhood pizza joint.
business	iLxG2Oo8HNSZFvJvba4W6g	Well the atmosphere is excellent - especially in CU. The staff was all very friendly and attentive. Kudos to them! The food was a bit better than average but nothing to knock your socks off. A good place to go with family or friends.They have a cheese sauce that is a bit spicy but tasty!	Great location and atmosphere. Authentic and Mexican American fare that was served in generous portions and DELICIOUS! The Guadalajara burrito was simple and SO flavorful. Hubs had Molcalambres and ranked them near the top of his fajita list. Not hoiity toity; not trying to be hip and trendy like Maize. Will come back whenever in town.	Love this place! The waitstaff is great and friendly, they are very quick but also allow you to relax and not feel rushed. I go here in the summer with some friends and we just sit on the patio (great outdoor seating) and drink margaritas and enjoy the complimentary fresh chips and salsa. Also great food!	They took a while to bring the food, my son ordered a chicken quesadilla that was very soggy and tasteless, the rest of the food was edible but far from good, place was ok, it's far from the best but if you hungry and desperate you can certainly go eat there.	Good food at a great price, the restaurant has become a great lunch destination. The food is basic American-Mexican combinations (burrito, enchilada, tamale for example) with very quick service. Honestly have not been to a sit down restaurant with such speedy service during the lunch rush.	Their food is decent, but the reason I'm writing this review is their healthy margarita. It's incredible and I'm not even usually a margarita fan! My husband ordered the regular margarita and we both agreed that the healthy was much better than the regular margarita. Go try it!	The first time I went here, I ordered a taco salad with beef, and the beef was pink. Not brown on the outside and pink on the inside, pink pink pink. The second time I went, my friend and I had the same burrito combination platter and both of us got sick the next day.	Went here with a group to drink some margaritas and eat some chips and salsa. Wonderful service and friendly staff. I ordered a grande raspberry margarita and it was nice and strong. Chips were hot and delicious and salsa was good (wish it was spicier but that's a personal preference)	This American-Mexican restaurant serves good tasty good. The quality can vary, but overall the dishes are pleasing. The restaurant has great atmosphere and the staff are friendly. The service is also fast, making for a wonderful dining experience. There are very few times the food is undercooked or underwhelming.	This Mexican restaurant is a great place to get a margarita with chips and salsa. Their margaritas are very well done, and the chips and salsa are also good. The service is also pretty good, friendly and efficient. The rest of the food, however, is average at best. This restaurant is recommended mostly for having some drinks with friends.	Decent place for Mexican dishes featuring a patio for outdoor relaxation. Food quality is average, great atmosphere and location, friendly and courteous staff and quick service. Slightly recommended place.
business	ikI3t6meCr4_DpHHZs6N2w	Food was strictly ok, I've had way better dimsum. The service was pretty bad - the waiter kept coming by to see if we were done eating starting at 9: 30pm, when the restaurant closes at 10pm. I wouldn't go back.	I don't have a lot of good things to say about this place except that the food is decent but service is lacking. This restaurant is relatively new but will not last long if they do not change / improve things. Food is good but service needs to be improved (they are understaffed).	We had a great time at Kwan. The food wasn't cheap, but everything was really unique and pretty good. Service and staff was nice and friendly. I'd say the dim sum is comparable to uptown restaurants. This is a good choice if you live in midtown of Toronto.	Came here for the first time today for dim sum. I was really wanting to love it because it's so close to my place, but the service really let me down. The food came out very slowly and the servers weren't very attentive or friendly.	Not really a fan. High rent district forces higher pricing, but the food made me feel light headed, which is often the case if there is MSG consumption. Overall, the depth & complexity of the dim sum left me wanting for dim sum from Richmond Hill instead. I won't be back.	Hands down this is my new favorite go to for tasty and healthier Chinese. We tried 10 different dim sum items and they were all excellent and not drenched in oil. The space is quite elegant and the service was above average.	Was feeling under the weather one day at work so I decided to get some congee for takeout. I ordered the congee with century egg and pork for $5. It definitely hit the spot and was a good portion. Would like to return and try the dim sum some day!	As a Chinese restaurant catering to the affluent multicultural midtown clientele, this place has ALMOST nailed everything except for the service. The waiters are always in a rush, talk rudely and dictatively, make minimal eye contact and deliver (more like dump) dishes to the wrong table (especially during busy weekends) .Also be careful to check your bill before you pay.	This is trendy, upscale Chinese restaurant that sometimes hits a home run of food, but often misses the target when it comes to service. It's in a great location, clean, comfortable, and attractive on the inside. Sometimes, items on the menu are on point and offer generous portions, but other things are overly complex or drenched in too much MSG. The prices are up, and the service is often unreliable as servers can sometimes have an attitude or completely fail at being attentive.	A very elegant space. The food was quite expensive, everything was pretty good and really unique.  But the service delivery was very bad. The waiters were always in a hurry, talk dictatively and rudely, they also delivered dishes to wrong table.	This dim sum restaurant has mixed results. The food itself is fine, however the service leaves something to be desired. Servers are known for being unfriendly and inattentive. The price is fine, but unless the service improves, the restaurant is not recommended.
business	jLTJw1Gm9Q9KG-iS2PWkpA	This is probably my favorite Persian cuisine resturant in Vegas. The place is nicely decorated and very clean. I am very impressed with their food: the portions are huge and the food is delicious. I have tried their lamb shank and beef kebab.... Amazing!	It was a nice place in a very odd spot. Hard to find entrance and I don't think their vents work very well in kitchen since it was extremely smokey when we walked in. They don't have fountain soda only cans, so no free refills. The food was ok. Not anything I really think we would go back for though.	Great food and we had a great time here interfering a party that seemed to be going on here. The family platter we got was sooo good, would definitely return! I also really liked the sour milk yogurt drink they have here.	If you are looking for great Iranian (Persian) or Mediterranean food this is the place to go! They have the best food and the greatest customer service. If you are in Vegas stop by this place, don't miss out on it!	I am very excited that I found this restaurant. They offer a very good lunch special menu with good prices for generous portions of delicious food. I plan on returning often. The beef koobideh kabob was succulent and the side salad was refreshingly bright.	I highly recommend American Gypsy Cafe. I stop by for lunch or dinner whenever I'm in Vegas. I have ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and I have never been disappointed. Great food, great service, great all around dining experience!	Eaten there twice so far and both time everything has been excellent. Very tasty food and the owner actually goes in the back and cooks it all up himself. Falafel appetizer and hummus are great starters and the beef koobideh kabobs are great. My friend had the chicken koobideh kabob and loved it. Lunch specials have great deals too.	I saw ants in the kitchen area on the way to bathroom. Do not eat here!!! Omg unsanitary. Be aware!! I canceled my order and left asap. You could get staph infection from ants and other bugs. Costumer beware!	The overall dining experience at American Gypsy Cafe is excellent. The food is tasty, the portions are generous, and the prices are very reasonable. The sanitary conditions are perhaps questionable, as ants were spotted in the kitchen. Still, the quality of the service and food make this a great choice for Persian dining.	This restaurant is one of the better Mediterranean restaurants in town. The food is overall very well-liked, and the service is very good. The prices are also pretty good. Overall, this is a good restaurant that is well-recommended for Mediterranean/Persian food.	The food, service and all around dining experience is great. Such a nice place in an odd spot. They have only cans and no fountain soda, so there are no free refills. The place is clean and very nicely decorated. The portions are massive and the food is very delicious. The customer service is great and the price is good.
business	joTw5858fDh3Y_rF0NDOsg	Great service, reasonable prices, and generous portions. What more could you ask for? How about good food! My lunch special of beef enchiladas were flavorful and came with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream. The standard sides of rice and beans were moist and delicious. Chips and salsa were, like the entire meal, several notches above average.	The service was okay. The food is awful. I don't want a chicken taco that is full of lettuce. Let alone all of them are just stuffed with lettuce and hardly any meat. Not to mention food was not very hot when it got to the table. I will not eat there again.	Best fish taco I've had since leaving South Florida!! Great bartender too! Can't remember his name but he was super fun, pretty buff, and was always doing something! Lol Highly recommend going for a magi taco. That's the only thing I tried and it was so good I ordered another! Can't wait to go back.	Just left, didn't get waited on after 15 minutes of being in the bar area. Bartender / server saw me standing at end of the bar, ignored me, served 2 men that were there at least 10 minutes after we walked in.	This place was tasty even though my the meat on my taco salad was a little dry. It had a great atmosphere that would be great for families. They were super helpful with any questions I had and always kept my glass full. Overall, I had a great time.	Went in for lunch today the place was actually pretty empty so I was surprised at how long it took the food was good not amazing but good would go back. For some reason I just think the one on Northern was always better when I was growing up	I am an Arizona native I used to love this place. WHAT HAPPENED!!! This place is gross. I ordered the burrito enchilada style Gross! The chips were cold I hate that. The service was fine but the food was horrible. Never going back!!!!!!!	I've been twice now. .once at lunch and once at happy hour... service is terrible. At 1130 we waited for 10 min before being acknowledged and brought to a take. Hh we waited for drinks we waited for food.	The food and service of this bar and restaurant are very hit-or-miss. Sometimes the service is fine, but often it is very slow, even when the restaurant is not busy. The food can be good, but can also be slow, cold, and stuffed with cheap fillers like shredded lettuce. This place is not very well recommended.	This restaurant is more of a miss than a hit. Customers have complaints of waiting for long periods of time to be recognized, and end up leaving out of frustration. Theres a lot of different menu options, but there seems to be problems with the temperature of the food. It has a nice atmosphere that people enjoy. Seating and taking orders promptly, then getting hot food and proper portions to their customers will make this a nice place to go to.	The service was pretty okay, but the food was awful and not actually very hot. The chicken taco is full of lettuce and stuffed with lettuce with hardly any meat. The burrito enchilada style was gross and the chips were cold. Super helpful with whatever questions and the bartender was great too. The prices were reasonable and the portions generous.
business	k9RUMKASTB6QZ-NkfnN8Fg	Go for drinks and the great view but not for the food. The scallops were tasty but heirloom tomatoes and burrata had little flavor. Skip the underdone bruschetta. It was cold and prosciutto had an unexpected sweet taste. The waitress was nice and didn't charge us for the uneaten appetizer. Nice drink menu with reasonably priced wine.	What can I say, Eno Vino is one of my top 5 in Madtown. The small plates are better than full meals at some places, and of course the wine selection is outstanding. But probably the most significant draw that really puts the icing on the cake is the location and VIEW. Great photo ops and ambience for a nice Barolo and bruschetta plate.	This place is awesome. First of all great views and cocktails are pretty good. They know how to shake and stir em. We had a shit ton of stuff I was there for a work function with work so it all kind of blurred together but we literally had at least two of everything I was disappointed with nothing.	Wowee sooo delicious and the view is great of the Capital. Different kinds of bruschetta., shrimp ceviche, and calamari fries with a great spicy dipping tomato sauce. We wanted to try the truffle fries but couldn't fit them.	Eno Vino never fails to impress. I've been here during peak hours, and at times when I'm one of 5 people in the bar. Each and every time, I've been made to feel special! From long conversations about wine re-carbonating methods, to getting free food because of minor chef mistakes, Eno Vino has proven they are dedicated to customer service	What fantastic views of Madison from Eno Vino downtown! This bar is an amazing addition to the downtown scene. My husband and I went on a busy Saturday night and despite it being quite busy we were able to find a spot fairly quickly. I highly recommend visiting this hip bar & bistro!	Don't know why I didn't stop in sooner, it's bright and loud with excellent views of the Capital area. They have a solid drink menu and small plates. Of all the plates we had the Goat cheese tortellini really stood out! Parking nearby.	I live the original Eno vino way better in term of serving speed and quality of services including the way cheeseboard is not being served with wood board here in downtown location. Foods are still good. But table is small. AC is not strong. And very very noisy	Eno Vino bar is renowned for excellent drinks and an impressive view of the Capital worth experiencing. Service quality is great and staff are dedicated. Drinks menu is comprehensive and dishes comprise tasty small plates. Overall, a recommended place.	The food is very good and the view it gives of downtown is impressive. It can be very noisy during peak service, usually on weekend nights. The smaller plate offerings can be better than full plates at other places. Location is highly regarded. The staff is friendly and customer service is at a high level.	Eno Vino's best feature is the amazing view of the city. The wine selection is also very strong. The rest of the food is good, as well. The customer service is friendly and accommodating. Overall, this is a highly recommended bar / restaurant.
business	kUuMZR8fPZjiCVcwPoNKlg	This is one of my favorite places to go. Their food is all fantastic, unique and delicious appetizers and the have a great happy hour. I would say prices are the middle of the road. It's always freezing in there, as a heads up- but the food is worth it! Definitely recommend!	Had a good experience at the Wexford location. We both ordered burgers that were tasty with a good bun and the fries were top notch. Friendly and attentive servers as well. The menu selection is nice with lots of sandwiches, wraps, and salads. The beer selection is decent as well. Overall, good experience and we'll go back!	Not a good place to take your kids! The spaghetti sauce is to spicy for your kids to eat. Also the grilled cheese was burnt. We had to go to a fast food restaurant after leaving this place to get our kids something to eat.	So disappointed! This is our standard brunch spot with friends and it's always been great until this visit. Portions were very small, most of our orders were incorrect and the quality of ingredients has gone way down. This place used to be great, not sure what's happened.	This place is always delicious. The brunch is awesome and they have Mimosas with options for juice. I asked for light orange juice and they added the perfect amount. The sweet potato tots are good but the dipping sauce was even better. They always have great specials and happy hours. The burgers were perfect cooked to order and the staff was friendly	Great menu - lots of different menu ideas for the area! Love the Thai salad and homewrecker sandwich! Ruben rolls are awesome for happy hour! Happy hour is super busy so get there earlier or be prepared to wait a hot minute!!	Not yo 'stereotypical dive bar with a healthy craft draft list and some unexpected twists on burgers, sammies, and appetizers. The sweet potato tots will satisfy even the sweetest of tooths especially with the cinnamon + brown sugar butter dip that comes with. Surprisingly addictive. Props to the service on a very busy Pens night playoff win!	I eat here regularly. It is family favorite. You get better service if you sit at the bar rather than at a table. Tuesday is 1 / 2 off sandwiches and Wednesday is 1 / 2 off basic burgers. If you like micro brews they always have many on tap.	The menu is the shining star by far! The variety of brunch ideas and craft beers is endless. The wait staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Sometimes has longer waits depending on the time of day. The cooks come up with really creative and delicious options. Overall pure indulgence for a sweet tooth with a great vibe!	Popular opinion is divided on loving or hating the food, often depending on the visit and the time of day - meaning whether they are super busy or not.  The menu has a lot of variety, yet children may find some dishes too spicy for their taste.  The staff is friendly and provide a great happy hour.	This is a nice bar with a good draft list and a good selection of items on the menu. The burgers, sandwiches and appetizers are all worth a try. Tuesdays and Wednesdays have good specials but the happy hour and random specials are a good value too. Happy hours do get busy though! Staff is friendly and the place is family friendly as well. Overall this craft bar is worth a try.
business	keJGpYownJ-j2zQJ5huvqg	Pretty cool bar and a neat area of town. Off the beaten path of regular tourist attractions. Place has been around for a long time and the Mac n Cheese options are plentiful and pretty good. Relaxed atmosphere and good service.	We hiked up [what felt like] a bazillion hills to get here and I can't be upset about it because everything was so good. It was Saturday brunch and we had the mimosas, which seemed heavy on the champagne so no complaints. Everyone loved every item they ordered.	Good local hang out! The staff can be hit or miss but the food is always good.My favorites are the fried pickles and the grilled cheese burger. It's definitely the best burger in the neighborhood.They have a good beer selection as well with outside seating, as long as it's not too cold.	Great find for visitors from out of town. We are for work and don't like chains. We found Bingham Tavern on Yelp. We thought the reviews sounded great so we came on over for dinner. Our waitress Katelyn was fabulous.	Great food, great service. Great spot to watch the game! This place has an awesome atmosphere! They have so many selection on beer! The prices are terrible! I would for sure recommend this spot for lunch, happy hour or just a great pre game spot!	Made a reservation an hour an advance and we're told we had a 45 minute wait upon arrival. Could not order from the normal menu (which is a shame because it looked great) and could only get a breakfast brunch.	What a great local bar / restaurant. The menu is phenomenal and the waitstaff is very attentive and fun. This place is a must try for anyone new to the mountain or those who want to have a great night. We love it h	Brunch with the wife and some friends GREAT food and service I would recommend the Bloody Mary very good - top notch even we really Like the atmosphere, the new Bar area looks great! we will definitely be back for dinner and drinks	In the neighborhood, it's definitely the best burger. The staff can be either hit or miss, but the food is very good. There is an outside seating and also a good beer selection. The bar is pretty cool around a neat area in town. The Mac n Cheese variety are much and pretty good. The atmosphere is very relaxing.	This is a good, small, local bar and restaurant. The food is good and the drinks from the bar are excellent. The bar also has a wide selection of beers. The staff and service are great, and the atmosphere is relaxed and pleasant. Overall, this is a great place for brunch or a small meal.	This bar has a large menu full of a variety of different foods. Mac and cheese is one of their specialties.  They also have a large beer selection available.  Service is generally good and it has a fun atmosphere, and is a good place to hang out morning or night. Overall this place is highly recommended for food or drink.
business	lC1bj0QhHp8cyzUtvrmeBQ	Great taste and consistency. You MUST stop here. Perfect size of small bowl, efficient checkout, owners are smart, generous with tastings, enthusiastic about their craft. Wish we had one in Nashville...... in my Street.... in my House.	Best gelato, so creamy and full of flavor! The cheesecake gelato tastes like actual cheesecake! And you can sample every flavor if you want! The creamy cookie is also delicious! A perfect treat for a hot Arizona day! I can't wait to come back!	Yes! Real, creamy, flavorful gelato. The best I've had. I had peanut butter with a little scoop of banana recommended by the owner. My husband had champagne with a little chocolate. This will be our new place. Goodbye Gelato Spot.	The best Gelato! I always go with my family and recommend my clients here. The shop is super cute inside and the owners are so nice and welcoming All the time. You can try samples which makes it hard cause they are all so good! Highly recommended!!	My 9 year old son and I tried Pussycat Gelato for the 1st time. The gelato was amazing and we would return from ahwatukee again. The partners who own the shop were generous in telling us all about the gelato and providing numerous samples. When my 9 year old couldn't decide what flavor, the owner allowed him to have 4 flavors in his cup.	This place was fantastic! The flavors were both fresh and intense. The young man that waited on us was so pleasant and friendly. I eat ice cream every single day and I can honestly tell you that this is the best ice cream / gelato / yogurt total experience I have ever had. Don't miss a visit here.	The name caught our eye and the posters on the wall. Hahaha. The guys working were so friendly! And their gelato is delicious and they had some unique flavors. I ended up with the espresso toffee dream and the double chocolate. It was sooooo good! Esp the espresso toffee! It was so flavorful yet not overpowering. Prices are reasonable too!	Sensational out of this world, Frederick is the most gracious host you will ever find. As for his hand crafted Gelato hands down better than Italy or any other countries I have visited!, I wish I lived her I would move in	Pussycat Gelato is popular for its well known, creamy and flavorful gelato which always exceed expectations. There are various exciting flavors and customers are allowed to try samples before choosing. Staff and management are remarkably pleasant and enthusiastic about their craft. Overall highly recommended.	The gelato is flavorful and very consistent. Tastings are free and generous, and the staff is always welcoming. The inside décor is cute and gives a good experience while there. The flavors are rich yet not overpowering. Some of the flavors offered a very unique with a good assortment of choices.	Pussycat Gelato is one of the best places to satisfy any sweet cravings. The owners are very generous, friendly, and they put a lot of passion into their craft. The unique flavors such as cheese cake, espresso toffee, and peanut butter with banana are fantastic and the prices are affordable.
business	mBeZ3dQzUPV60Oa26k3qHw	I agree with many of the other reviews! Harkins has great customer service, I love the loyalty cup.This location is nice, good parking, chairs and everything still comfortable. Great popcorn, they have Dr. Pepper (my fave).	Godzilla was awesome, this Harkins Theaters was very busy, more than normal or maybe because its the weekend. Either way we enjoyed our movie and the staffs are friendly and theater was very clean and well taken care of. No trash on the floor and everything was just great.	Like I mentioned before.... Very clean well kept place. Went back and they made my salt free popcorn with a smile and no hair! Managers contacted me and made sure to ask employees to pull hair back. Definitely the cleanest theater in town.	Love this theatre it's ALWAYS clean and is never packed. Unlike Harkins Gateway on 99th Ave and McDowell which always is over crowded with people. Great places to shop and eat after or before a movie. I would recommend this theatre to anybody.	Happy to be a Harkins customer. Prices for concessions are steep but that is somewhat expected. I like that they give you a free popcorn if you buy a $25 gift card. Use the gift card to pay for tickets and other goodies. Upgrade to a large popcorn and save the bag for next time. Nice way to get more for your dollar.	I love this movie. Clean. Friendly. Management is always on their employees about customer service. They are a bit pricey but worth it. I always go an hour early because the theatre gets busy quick. Love the shopping and food around it. Always clean and on time. Awesome experience	Love it here there's always plenty of room Harkins Theatres and lots of things to do in this little shopping plaza, there's lots of good food a lots of good shopping around here all the family and kids living around here it's nice	Harkins is an amazing company. They offer the best perks! But this location has Jozie, GODDAMNIT.... This woman is smoking hot with that amazing red hair.Even with the old style seats i'm coming here just to catch a glimpse.	The theater is clean and the workers are always friendly. It gets a bit busy at times but is well taken care of. The parking lot has plenty of space and the theater seats are nice and cozy. Can be a bit pricey but there are some good deals on offer. Overall a quality theater experience.	Harkins Theaters is a well-kept, clean, and friendly place to watch a movie.  There is hardly ever large crowds in the theaters, and the staff are always nice and friendly.  There are also numerous food options for any taste.	Harkins Theatres is a great place to go watch a movie. The quality of the theater is superb. It is always clean and very well taken care of. The customer service is top notch. Nice location, excellent perks and just all around a wonderful theater.
business	mSibSn9jCe8zKNyPOhyysg	Came here at 11: 30 am first, I just couldn't handle the smell. And asked to use the grill for all you can eat. Apparently they don't do all you can eat around that time. I'm disappointed	Never coming back to this restaurant again! The staff is very unprofessional and disrespectful. My husband found a hair in his food and the manager didn't want to re-make his order nor give him a refund. Stay away from this restaurant!	Service is slow, have to ask for refills or slurp your straw. Daeji bulgogi, short ribs, and bulgogi are as good as any other KBBQ. Kim chi Chigae and Dumpling Tofu soup not good, the flavor is just not right. Side dishes are average. Takamatsu was way better. No kimbap. Probably won't be back.	This place is pretty good. There are not a lot of Korean BBQ spots in Arizona that actually have grills. We sat in a nice booth and the table had a grill. The side dishes are not as good as other places. The meats were delicious. Overall we enjoyed this place and will be going back.	My first time to this place and it was so delicious. The Siracha Honey Pork Shoulder was our absolute favorite! Such unique food and a unique experience. We are stuffed! The prices are super reasonable and the flavor is superb. We will definitely be back.	This will become the newest hottest spot in the east valley! Food is amazing, ambiance is very nice, workers are so pleasant, very nice hangout place! Come and try their bbq or try their restaurant menu. You won't be disappointed!	Never coming back to this place because we waited for 1 hour for food only to tell us that our order was never in! Lol. This place is such a joke and always will be. Horrible service. We will be telling our friends and family not to come here!	Great service! I liked it when it was Takamatsu, but now they are Arirang, all the ban chan were fresher, the server took the time to get to know us, and unlike the last few visits when it was still Takamatsu, they weren't out of a single item we ordered! LOVE the new owners.	An absolute favorite is Siracha Honey Pork Shoulder. Such a unique food and experience. Super reasonable prices and superb flavor. This will turn out to be the latest hottest spot in east valley. Ambiance is so nice, workers are pleasant and a very cool hangout place. The service is great.	The food at this Korean BBQ place is generally good, in particular the takamatsu is highly recommended.  The side dishes are not recommended. The service is very bad,  they are slow and unprofessional. Overall this place is probably not recommended.	Average Korean BBQ spot. Service is generally poor, prices are fair, food is just decent and sometimes below average. Staff is nice and friendly but management and customer satisfaction practices are unsatisfactory. Overall not a recommended place.
business	mhMhYsmJB4t0-ok1ABvNBg	Awesome place. The bar is sleak and clean, the staff is friendly, the draft beer selection is glorious, their craft cocktails are delicious, and hell they even have good food. Awesome spot, not the cheapest, but you definitely pay for the atmosphere, the taste, and the generosity. Highly recommend you check it out!	What a great new beer and wine bar! We stopped in for happy hour on Friday and really enjoyed it - laid back vibe, super friendly service, and an extensive list of beer and wine selections. I thoroughly enjoyed my Portuguese white wine on tap... thanks for the great recommendation! Next time we'll bring our dog to enjoy the dog friendly patio.	Great food, great drinks (try the Sake Bloody Mary!) and wonderful staff! The steak and fries are the most tender and taste like a $60 steak. Also has beautiful burning man art on the wall. I will definitely come back!	Was recommended to this place by a friend. I was immediately impressed by the depth and breadth of the drink selection. Then the food came out... I was blown away!! It was incredible! I definitely recommend this place to anyone participating in exploring local restaurants and finding out the hidden gems that are right around the corner.	Fantastic vibe, perfected menu of items you'll recognize but completely reimagined to be just better, and a wine selection that even your up-tight friends will appreciate, in a laid back, inclusive, industrial-chic space that is dog- friendly! Try it. Seriously, try it- the neighborhood is completely turned around.	Recently moved nearby, and was so happy I stopped in! Great beer selection that rotates often, so make sure you buy a growler to go if you love what you're drinking, chances are others are loving it too! Sliders are bombbbb	Im new to the area to I went to this place to eat tonight, no one welcomed me I had to ask for a menu and a seat. I was never asked if I wanted anything to drink nor was I asked anything so I left. I would not recommend this place if you want any good service.	Super cute! It has a stainless steal look / appearance to it. Small location, tucked away in a mini business strip. Parking can be a challenge as it is in a small plaza, although I have not encountered not being able to find a parking spot. It has a neighborhood feel to it, with friendly staff.	It is located in a small plaza and parking can be challenging. There is a neighborhood feel to it and the staffs are friendly. The food and drinks are great.  Great wine bar and new beer. The fries and steak are the most tender and the taste is amazing, but the price is not the cheapest.	This industrial designed restaurant is known for offering a wide selection of great alcoholic drinks. There is a chill, neighborly ambiance, especially with the fact that there is a dog-friendly patio. While not cheap, the food taste like higher price food.	This bar / restaurant has an impressive wine a beer selection. The beer selection in particular is wide-ranging and changes regularly. The food is also very good. The service is friendly. The decor has a pseudo-industrial stainless steel look, and the atmosphere is pretty laid back. This is recommended for those who want to try new beer or wine.
business	mmKrNeBIIevuNljAWVNgXg	Tim and Tami always always always have the best customer service and do the best nails. I will NEVER go anywhere else. Even after weeks my nails look and feel as good as they did when I first got them done! I'm so dedicated I recommend and bring in all my friends!	Definitely my new nail salon! Everyone is so friendly and kind, I felt so welcomed! B did an amazing job on my nails. He made sure everything was perfect and happily changed something to make me happy. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants A + work at a totally affordable price. Love it!!:)	Amazing service and nails. This is the second time I have been here, they did a perfect job again. They get it done fast yet with precision. Everyone is so friendly there too. Best nail salon I have ever been too. I'm glad I found it.	I really enjoy coming here to get my nails done. They do a wonderful job on both pedis and nails. It is nice and clean inside. They are very friendly and welcoming. It is worth it to stop in and try it out.	My first set of acrylics ever... I decided 27 years was a lot enough time to wait, and I'm SO happy with them. I'm not a huge nail person, and was glad to stumble upon this salon. My nail tech was quiet, clean, and very detail-oriented. Very pleased with my experience here and I recommend this place.	I called to make an appointment for later today for 3 adults and 2 kids and the man who answered the phone said 'we only have 2 techs today' we can't do that. Poor customer service and I never even went in.	Golden Nails has been my nail place for almost a year so it was surprising to see new management. However B did an AMAZING job on my coffin chrome nails and Nancy was extremely helpful figuring out how I wanted my nails done too. Definitely excited to keep coming back!	Seriously the best service I have ever gotten at a Tempe nail salon!! I walked in and they helped me right away. Nancy helped me pick the perfect color and was very honest and up front about everything! I wanted something very natural and using the dip method, I love my nails!!	This nail salon is one of the best in the area. The service is excellent. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating. Their work is also excellent, with great attention to detail. Overall, this is a highly recommended nail salon.	This is such a wonderful nail salon all the way around. The customer service that this nail salon offers is amazing. Everyone is so polite and very attentive. The service is top notch. You can not ask for anything more. Overall, it is definitely recommended.	It is very clean and nice inside. Everyone is so kind and friendly. They do an amazing job on both nails and pedis. They get it done with speed and precision with a price that is very much affordable. They have the best customer service.
business	nGuhjKrZjqvB2xodGo7m7Q	This location caters to drive-thru. Came in to dine-in and they served 12 vehicles while we waited for 2 kids meal and 1 half sandwich. Ended up having to go back up and tell them we needed to change it to go. Spent 20 minutes inside just to come out with a bag of food to eat in the car.	This place is awesome! They have added breakfast and a Freestyle Coke Machine! There are so many choices and things to try. I love the drive thru and the inside is very comfortable and clean. You can tell that the place has been around awhile but the workers take pride in what they do. Delicious! Must try!	0820 in the am, the sign open wasn't on the mgr didn't even know, the inside was dirty, the soda machine disgusting, the countertops dirty, the floor dirty, the counter where you pick up food had crumbs all over it, this place needs the health department stat! Never going back!	I decided to have a sandwich and was craving the chewy bread from Schlotzsky. So I walked in and got the Turkey Bacon Club on sourdough. It was very good. Got the original chips and an ice tea. The store was clean, nice, and has a lot of seating areas. The staff was very friendly and nice.	Nasty, rude employees. The bathrooms are horrible. They always close early: went to drive through 20; minutes before closing, and they ignored me. I called, and a girl told me they were closed. Not the first time this has happened.	Giving this a 2 star. Just left this location and we waited over 20 min for 2 kids pizza and a turkey sandwhich. The store was not busy and no one told us what was taking so long. When we got our food, there was not even a sorry about the wait. Very disappointed in this trip	Fourty five minutes for two sandwiches come on.... Staff properly. The new girl at the registrar screwed up the order twice, then we sat 45 minutes for two sandwiches along with the rest of the place of starving people. Will never come back! They say they cater it would be scary to see how long they would take to get it to my office!	I'm truly thankful I work down the street! I love their sandwiches... their reuben is a great 'getting to know reuben' type of sandwich. The saurkraut is good, not too tangy for a novice reuben connisseur like me. & They Serve Cinnabon Inside.	The food is of a high quality but the service is horrible. The food takes to long to come out and there is evidence of a lack of cleaning of by the staff. Would recommend getting a health inspector to check over this location before attempting to eat at this location.	This place is amazing. Breakfast have been added along with a freestyle coke machine. The choices and things to try are much. The inside is very clean and comfortable. The saurkraut is very good and not too tangy. The staff was very nice, friendly and take pride in what they do.	Wait times for food can sometimes be long. The inside cleanliness can be lacking at times. Employees can be unreliable and understaffed. The food is great when finally served after the wait times. Overall, is a good restaurant but quality of service can be rather risky depending on the day.
business	nm9aJr7qQadbkTP6lnXB1Q	Have gone here for over ten years. Great customers and good food. However, constant changes in managers (seven in the last three years) barrtenders, and waitresses have convinced me to take my business elsewhere. Unfortunately, replacing the old with the new doesn't always work.	Wings were amazing. Only issue is I went there to watch the AFC Championship game and the volume being down took away from the environment. But I never checked to see if they could raise the volume so I won't take away from them.	Best local bar. Everyday there is a special and Friday if u are creative you could get a free lunch. Fish is yummy. Salads are fresh. Terri is so fun. No bad days here. Like Stacy. She is a hard worker and very friendly. Consider this 'our place'. Closed. Sad but true	Been here a few times.. service is good, food is ok, but its the surroundings are interesting. Always smells funky in there.. like bratwurst and an sweatsock. Despite this i would return to watch a game or do some off track betting.	Service is 'OK'. Last time we went in we ordered chicken wings. When we got them they were undercooked. Yes, we should have said something but we were so grossed out and weren't having the best service experience so we just paid our bill and went on our way.	If I'm looking for a group of frowny faces from the staff, I know where to go. The bartender was rude and seemed to pay more attention to the people she knew and did more standing around then anything. Safe to say I won't be returning	Yay!!!! It's good to walk into this place and see a familiar faces!! The other bar tenders suck! But Megan is the best!!!! She is friendly and knows her shit. Un like the other rude nasty bitches working here!!!	I love this spot. Been coming in for years. They serve their beer in frozen glass and it's always cold & delicious. I also love their Wing Wednesday deal. 79 cent wings and they have @ 6 flavors. Plus they give you choice of fried or grilled. Awesome!	A bar that has been a mainstay in the area for many years. Unfortunately, things have changed for the worse. The staff, barring a few servers, come across as rude. The manager has changed and so has the restaurant. There is now a smell and the food is hit or miss.	Service is decent but at times seems selective and the turnover rate for workers is high. The environment is engaging with a particular smell and TV's around to watch sports games. Food is decent yet non-noteworthy with plenty of worthwhile affordable deals.	The bar is among the best local bars. All days are special days. The beer is served frozen glass and always cold and delicious. The workers including the managers, bartenders and waitresses are rude. They don't pay attention to customers.
business	o2O4qWlo4O0aI5oEZsUHBQ	I didn't get the sushi but the 3 other people I was with said it was some of the best they've ever had. I had the garlic stir fry with tofu and brown rice and it was very good. They even got it right when I asked for no mushrooms or water chestnuts.	THE BEST Asian Bistro in all of Charlotte!!!! LOVE this place! I have been here more then any other restaurant in the 8 years I've been living here and it is always consistent. Great food, great service and great atmosphere!	As a sushi connoisseur, I believe Jade serves some of the best sushi in Charlotte. It is fresh and has exceptional flavor--however, it is also a tad pricey. Even still, the cost is worth it, as their cherry blossom rolls are to die for.	It's a good thing the food is good, because the service sucks. If you go for lunch and only have an hour, ask for your check as soon as you get your food... might make it out within an hour.	BEST SUSHI IN CLT PEOPLE! Jade is located in the Ballantyne area of South Charlotte. If you are looking for sushi that is fresh with many unique options this is the spot! They have everything from Pad Thai to Vietnamese, to fresh fish! My favorite is really the sushi, such great food... a must when you are in Charlotte!	We went here on a nice night for dinner so we were able to sit outside, which was nice.The food was excellent. We ordered three types of rolls and they were all delicious. They have a good menu of both regular rolls and specialty ones which is nice. They have a good location and I will definitely be back:)	I love going to Jade for a evening dinner. When the weather is beautiful and you can sit on there patio and enjoy the comings and goings of the people below. It's always a excellent experience! The food is delicious, ambience is perfect for sipping a martini and enjoying good conversation. The sushi menu is long and comes out fresh.	Top notch Restaurant Great ServiceGreat foodVery clean, more up scale. Not cheapBut Great.Will definitely come back (maybe tomorrow) We have had Sushi all over Charlotta and nothing compares to Jade. They waiters are tops.There food is so fresh. They dishes are so original.Great Job Jade.....	In Charlotte, this is the best Asian Bistro. Great food, service and atmosphere. The food is very delicious and the ambiance is perfect. The sushi is fresh with an exceptional flavor. The tofu with garlic stir fry and brown rice was amazing. The location is perfect, waiters are tops and the dishes original.	This has a nice variety of sushi and everything is served fresh. The Asian food is delicious and upscale so it can be pricey. There is also outdoor patio seating which provides a great atmosphere. The service is great, but it can be slow. This is the best sushi in Charlotte.	Jade has excellent customer service and serves high end sushi rolls, made fresh, with other menu options. The location is great with an outside patio where customers can sit and enjoy the ambiance. The price tag is heavy but the benefits from the food and service leaves it as a place to recommend.
business	oAq3-dXyDT3k4Mluc1ftTA	nice place for a good teppanyaki dinner. and pretty reasonably priced considering it's right in the heart of yorkville! It's my go-to whenever I'm in the mood for a no fuss yorkville meal. Their sushi rolls are pretty good too. This place gets really busy on weekends and during festival season so make sure you have a reservation!	Came for lunch, the Teppenyaki was very good, the chef was fun and entertaining. The prices were incredibly reasonable. I didn't have sushi, but others did and said it was fantastic as well. Would come back for sure.	One of my favourite things about. Yamato is that it has a patio! The service is friendly and professional and the food is fresh and delicious. I had the $35 sashimi platter; it was generous and really high quality.	I've always loved Yamato. I haven't been in a very long time but as I recall, excellent service and the sashimi is always served at the perfect temperature, (I consider this a very important factor with sashimi, as one should)!	The quality of food was average. I've had better sushi at Moto sushi (at Yonge and Sheppard). The waitresses were pretentious and snoopy.When it comes to sushi, there are NO lunch specials. At all.The cheapest roll is $7 California roll, of average taste.I would not go to this place again.	Sushi was of low-quality. The type you expect to get in the prepackaged food section of your local grocery store. Was expecting much better. Servers literally reach all the way over the table to grab your water glass. Plenty of better options in the area. Will not be going back to this place.	I had the grilled vegetable teppanyaki, and I thought it was OK, nothing particularly special. The service was excellent though -- the waitresses were very stealthy (you barely noticed them clearing your table, etc), the atmosphere is very quiet and calm, and the decor is nice. Good for groups!	I had the ribeye steak combo medium rare. It was so soft and buttery and just so good!! The server was so nice and it was just a good time! got there around 2 during the lunch hours and there was no wait time. Very good food! Very entertaining show!	This restaurant provides average quality food for reasonable prices considering the location. The teppenyaki is an especially popular choice.  The atmosphere is generally calm, the decor is pleasant and patio seating is available. The service itself has mixed reviews.	This restaurant offers many different types of food such as teppanyaki and sushi, however, there are no lunch specials. The service is average, and the pricing is about the same. There is outside seating, and the atmosphere is calm.	The teppanyaki and sashimi at this restaurant are recommended and both are very good. The service is very good and the place has an entertaining atmosphere and the prices are very reasonable for the food you get. Overall this place is recommended.
business	oDM09XMN-FG0ii_gdVMrTw	Pretty sure if you've been to one little Caesars pizza you been to them all I have no complaints about this store every time I order I'm in and out quick. They always have my hot and ready pizzas ready so I'm a happy guy lol	This location is a joke even 3 years later since i wrote my first review, sign says hot and ready between 4-8, blatant lies. Just went at 510 today and nope 15-25 minutes. Managers here don't care. Why should they of the owners don't do shit about it.	Just spent the last 30 minutes trying to get through on the phone line... it just kept ringing every time I tried. Not wasting my time anymore. Papa Johns actually answers their phone and they are right across the street... Save your self some time and aggravation... just take your money elsewhere...	This location is a hit or miss, especially with the employees. Since when was a pepperoni pizza with cheese and sauce custom made? I got charged an extra $1 for a custom made pizza when I only ordered a pepperoni deep dish. Plus the crust is so hard it taste like it's been sitting for a few hours..	Though they advertise hot and ready from 4-8, they never seem to be prepared. I have to wait 10-15 minutes to get our pizza. Frustrating!!! Atheist they could say thank you for my patience, but nope. Sit and wait...	Biggest bunch of jerks at this store. I called ahead for a supreme pizza. I gave them my name and even spelled it for them. The little bitch behind the counter was rude. Didn't have my name and didn't give a shit either. Fucking hoodlums work at this store. Go to Hungry Howies.	0 stars if I could. We tried twice and both times were the pits. Worst pizza hands down. First pie was square and NO sauce. Dough was bland. Second time we got a $5 cheese pie for kids and again.. No sauce there were numerous air bubbles and little cheese. Just horrible. Never again.	I would hope the owner reads these reviews. He / she needs to find a real manager somebody who can whip this location into shape. I have never been there when they have pizza actually ready for customers that are there. They are always behind, and they have very poor customer service skills.	This location is frustrating to deal with and rarely has pizzas hot and read between 4 - 8 pm, as advertised. They have very poor customer service and it's difficult to get through on the phone at times. Sometimes, the pizzas don't taste great, needing more sauce and cheese. Overall, not recommended.	This Little Caesars has a big problem with making pizza on time. Wait times on average 15 minutes after placing an order. Calling ahead of time is fruitless as the phone doesn't get answered. The employees don't care and can be rude. Pizza isn't poor and not worth it. Very poor management has led to poor customer service.	For this location of Little Ceasers good customer service is virtually non-existent with both the employees and managers. There is never any food hot and ready for direct take out as advertised by the company and the pizzas, when served, are very poorly made.
business	oM6TsEcgj4i9McivZnu5EA	Honey did an amazing job! Sweet girl love my fall nails. She didn't hurt me which is what usually scares me. The last time I came in the girl had cut me.... but I loved my appointment this time! Go see her.	first time here. not bad for a list bit of me time, and a quick polish change. Prices are compatible to other nail salons in the area, and its right next door to a Sally's Beauty Supply were you can pick up a nice bottle of bottle of polish for touch ups.	I was in the area and called to see if they do walk-ins. They took me right in! Very clean and nice looking nail salon. I will definitely come back and get pedicure done again. Thanks Kim for doing a good job!	Hadn't been in here in over a year because we had moved. Came back and it was just as clean and friendly. Had a great relaxing pedicure. Reasonably priced and they didn't rush through anything. Hope I'm back in the area next time I'm in need of a pedi.	Pretty Cool place for toe up keep. I get my feet handled and taken care of and my gal gets both toes and hands taken care of here. small, funny Asian girl is funny and kinda a smart ass but makes waiting funny and hearing her talk lol.	Fastest fill ever! I walked in expecting to be there at least an hour, but to my surprise was out in half the time. Kate did a very through job and gave me exactly what I wanted. I'm pretty picky with nail quality and shape and she did a wonderful job. I will definitely be coming here from now on.:)	I'm sure glad that I didn't listen to the previous reviews. Tom did my nails and he did absolutely perfect with them! I will be returning Update: a year later and I still love this place! They never disappoint and Kim is the best! She always helps me get exactly what I want. The salon is the best!	I actually loved this place, It wasn't bad at all. The guy who did my pedicure did such a wonderful job... Best pedicure I've ever had, and I always go to different places trying to find a good place to go. But after coming here, I think I found my permanent place:)	This is a great place for pedicure; clean and nice looking salon offering reasonably priced services. Fast, relaxing and efficient service, caring staff with interesting and warm personalities. Overall a highly recommended place.	The saloon is nice looking, clean and friendly. For toe upkeep, it's pretty cool. The fill was the fastest ever and was done in half the expected time. Prices are reasonable and compatible to nail salons within that vicinity. This salon is the best!	A very clean and beautiful salon. Wait times are much shorter than other nail salons. The staff, from Kate, to Tom, to Kim, to Honey, are all friendly and do a great job. One of the best salons. Worth it every time.
business	on5wA9xgE-HZyBp19-yxsg	I had Angel and she was WONDERFUL. Not a single complaint about her or the establishment. She was very attentive, as was the manager. Making sure everyone was satisfied and checking on his employees. Definitely my new nail place!	I went here with my mom for two deluxe spa pedicures and it was really nice. The staff was friendly and the environment was welcoming. It's kind of hard to notice at first within Westgate, but it was a great experience and I definitely recommend it!	This place always does an excellent job! The people are so sweet and great at what they do. My gel manicures last the longest when they are done here! I don't know what they do differently but the polish seems to stay on longer without chipping or peeling off. This has become my go to nail place.	Well that was a disappointment. Sign said open until 6pm. I walked in the door at 5: 25pm the gentleman that saw me said come on in, however some lady cane running up and told me 'no, closed'. I won't give it another try	I would not recommend this salon. I was very dissapointed. I told the girl doing my pedicure that I am diabetic and to be very careful doing my feet. She cut me three times resulting in six visits to my doctor and two rounds of antibiotics. I went to tell the manager what happened and they were very rude and never even offered an apology.	My nail technician Kate was beyond Wonderful!!! Everytime I come to westgate nails she's the one to go to. If you're iffy about trying this nail salon just Go See KATE! She's my go to gal. Much love for West Gate Nails	Great service, I love this place and I will continue to go back, my only complaint is that one of the ladies did s shit job on my design cause she couldn't do it and instead of saying if I wanted a different design cause she wasn't capable of doing it to what I wanted she just did it anyways making it look bad	Disappointed when the sent me away at 6: 30 when sign clearly says they close at 8. More technicians in there than clients. They just lost a customer and will spread the word that they will send you away when it's convenient for them.	This nail salon has mostly positive reviews and satisfied customers. The staff is friendly and generally successful at meeting expectations. There have been complaints of customers being either cut or not happy with the appearance of their pedicure or manicure. Sometimes they close earlier than their scheduled working hours.	Average salon with friendly staff and welcoming environment. Poor time management as scheduled closing/opening times are not always adhered to. Service can be a hit and miss and staff is generally not very competent. Overall not a recommended place.	The nail technician and manager are very friendly and the salon looks good, but some of the nail technicians have a tendency to make mistakes and the salon doesn't admit to them. The nail salon tends to close early. While the official closing time may be 6 pm or 8 pm, that isn't the case.
business	os_m94NtcG7JQg095WdggQ	So fun there! I can't wait to go back and play a different board game! The best drink was the Earl grey tea and shots of espresso. Be sure to ask for almond milk if you are vegan:) The barista was so kind to change it out for my friend and I as we forgot to ask about other milk alternatives.	Great idea and they use Averys roastery for their coffee! That means the coffee is yummy! The customer service is great! They just need to grow a little! Support them, they deserve it! I highly recommend an AEROPRESS!	Love finding local gems like this! Really cute space, stage for open mic nights, an incredible amount of board games, and really creative drink menu. The barista was so kind and friendly, giving us drink recommendations that we loved. I had the bath bomb iced tea and it was very unique and tasty.	Cam in the other day and was pleasantly surprised! Really cute and rooms of fun looking games. Ordered espresso on ice and jazzed it up a bit. Really good espresso. Took my kiddo a cookie and it was amazing! Owner was working and recommended it. I'll be back for sure.	This is one my family's favorite chill spots. Jupiter and RJ are always so friendly and helpful. So clutch with the drinks; Emilio, Arnold Schwarzen-Palmer, and PO Double G are legit!!! It's a great way to get away from the phone screen and enjoy good old-fashioned board games like Monopoly, Risk, and my New Favorite Cash and Guns	I work near this location and was anxiously awaiting their opening. The staff is friendly and helpful. The drinks are tasty and there is a great selection of games to play in a clean, neat space. Stop in and support this local business!	This place is fantastic! The owner Abigail is a delight!!!! I'm usually a coffee girl but Abigail suggested a milk tea. Needless to say, their drinks are fantastic and they have a plethora of board games!! I can't wait to bring all of my friends there!!	Great Original recipe coffee and tea drinks. Fun place for ages 4 to 100 to play board games and just chill. Free WiFi and fun events weekly. It's a good place to put your phone down and hang out with friends and family.	This is a great place with a stage for open night.The staff are helpful, the barista is kind and friendly.  The rooms are great with a wide range of board games. A family friendly place, the drinks are tasty and amazing owners.

business	p0bg7la5-gaUJyBDjuOCxA	I've been taking two dogs to Furry Beginnings for about a year. One precious little mini schnauzer has gone to her reward but the other, my beautiful Zelda, has another appointment tomorrow. I've been happy with the results each time and will continue to use this groomer. The staff and the owner are among the nicest people ever!	My dog Mindy had her first grooming here since moving to Arizona. Everyone seemed very professional and Mindy looks great. I like the fact that they are kennel free. Rather opting to have pens with beds for each pet. The salon is very clean and the pricing is right where it should be. I'll be taking my dog there again!	We were 19 minutes late to our appointment and they told us they wouldn't take our dogs for their appointment. Oh well, at $85 per dog, we are fine with taking our business elsewhere. They never seem to remember us or our dogs whenever we come in anyway. We pretty much feel like we are just a number.	We take our 3 year old yellow lab in (Kona) for a shave and nail grinding. He looks amazing when they are done! He LOVES going there and everyone who works there is so nice and friendly! The facility is very clean. Their pricing is comparable to other places, but we know our dog is in good hands when he goes there!	Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place sooner. We've been loyal customers since it opened. Our cavalier always looks amazing after being groomed here. I love that they also have a do-it-yourself pet-bath option. The staff always listens and is helpful. Very clean facility too.	I brought in my two Pugs here and they loved it! They were pampered and walked out of there smelling good and clean. Of course, that didn't last long because those two love to get dirty. Furry Beginnings is a great place to bring your fur baby. The staff is amazing and very caring! You'll love this place!	Best groomer in Gilbert. The owners love dogs and people! The grooming is reasonable in price and the dog wash is fun for people and dogs too. They have great staff and a good selection of leashes, collars and other dog lover items.	We always get great treatment for our two yorkies from Darcy. She is great and really cares about our spoiled little girls. We moved a bit farther away and still value and trust them with our doggies that we don't even think about taking them anywhere else. We are always thrilled with their looks and the way we are treated!	The staff is very friendly and their skill is great. The staff always listens to what the customer needs. The pricing for the various dog services are average, and the results are very good. Everyone is very caring for the animals they help groom. There is a good selections of dog related items such as leashes and toys that can be purchased if needed.	Furry Beginnings is a great place to groom dogs; they offer a do-it-yourself pet-bath, the staff is nice and friendly to dogs and people alike. Very clean facility equipped an assortment of dog related items. Busy schedules so customers best keep to time. Overall great results with pets so definitely recommended.	The facility here is very clean and the staff is very friendly and loving. The dogs get treated very well and they love the groomers. They do not lock up the dogs in kennels here. They get to have room and beds in pens instead. The pricing here is relative to other groomers in the area.
business	p3cBYY8Tov5TOaXV2aY-wA	Very nice staff! It's always packed in here & I'm not surprised! Quality food! Lots of options! I absolutely love the vegan options as well as the GMO-free foods (all Trader Joe's brand is GMO-free). I have to say the prices are greats as well! Love TJ's!!	I love getting my Pirate Booty from here (the puffs people) and the ready made pizzas, pretty much everything that they have ready made is really good. The store can get pretty crowded, especially during the dinner hour rush. Employees are friendly and I recommend you take advantage of the samples throughout the store. Come hungry!	This store gives me a nice and warm feeling. The feeling that I didn't and won't have with Walmart Market. Trader Joe's has a lot of eye-catching snacks and healthy food. Therefore, I have no idea which items I should buy. If I can, I want to try everything. Absolutely, comeback	Checked out this location. Smaller than the Albuquerque NM store that we frequently visit but found the items we were needing but noticed selection was different or maybe I just wasn't finding what I needed. I didn't find the selection of jelly and jams that I wanted but that is okay.	Love this store... can't get enough of it. I have been going to Trader Joe's for years. This store always makes me happy. From great recepies idea to great selections of groceries. Staff is really friendly as well. Thumbs up Trader Joe on Camelback Rd!	This is a big TJ's. What else is there to say? It's a Trader Joes. Awesome food, great employees. I don't know what I could complain about. Skip Fry's and shop here. The food is healthier and taste better.	The parking for this location can be a madhouse because it's located in a very busy strip mall and largely due to the construction surrounding it. But in TJ fashion, it won't disappoint with all the usual goodies that make you feel so adult and domesticated shopping here. Staff is always awesomely happy and helpful.	This is my favorite Joe's. From SF to SD to Scottsdale, the T & C location is the best. Everyone here genuinely knows me and my son. They interact with you like a friend. Products are always great and when they're not they exchange with no hassle. Thanks to the whole staff for always being so welcoming.	This Trader Joe's has a lot of healthy food and snacks. The food options include vegan foods, GMO-free foods, and ready made foods like pizza and snacks. The staff is friendly, happy, and helpful. At times it can be busy and crowded, but overall this Trader Joe's is highly recommended.	The overall feel of the store was very pleasant. The employees were very nice, friendly and help with everything. Always have a very good selection of beers and other alcohol. They have a nice deli and plenty of fresh organic produce. They also offer very affordable prices on high quality grass-fed meat.	nice staff and the store overall. more positive than negative feelings are prevalent. the parking can be a problem at times, also the size is not very big.
business	pLPV7vybH3FMnT-Um7IQhQ	I'm so glad to find a place that makes delicious Appletinis. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and alcohol. Your cheesy fries and pretzel with cheese is good as well. The menu has a nice twist with Flight themes. I also like the different events they hold. Fun times are always had at Flight!	Cool bar with lots of space and picnic table seating. Went here to play Citizens of Humanity with some friends. Tots and fries were pretty good. I probably wouldn't get the veggie burger again - too soft and fell apart.It's next to Lucky's, so you can go next door if you get bored.	This is a pretty cool place. Tons of beer on tap. Large stage, Nice beer garden. Open space. The appetizers we did have were good. Bacon wrapped poppers, some fried pickles.. all good. Staff was on their game as well. Very impressed.	Came here on a Thursday when live bands were playing. Bands were awesome!!!! Had a Rueben with steak fries that were absolutely amazing. Best Rueben I have ever had in my entire life!!! Great place for parties or a date night! I highly recommend this place!!!	I'd give zero stars if it were an option. 'Top shelf open bar.' No jack, no Jameson, no Bacardi, no captain Morgan, no Red Bull, no Cuervo. 'That's like top, top shelf.' I've never heard of the rum or whiskey they poured but it came it a plastic bottle. Fucking disappointment.	I started my night off at this bar and ordered two vodka sodas for me and my friend, and was instead given waters. They still charged me for two vodka sodas and told me I was too intoxicated to serve? I was completely sober and ripped off. Shocked by the inability to fill a simple order and just flat out disappointed. Do not recommend.	The place to be for a South Carolina game! It's always packed with fans and a great atmosphere. Drink prices are reasonable and the music is great. When there's not a game Flights a good place for a casual beer. The food is pretty good for bar food. Definitely recommend the pretzel or tater tots.	Food was average. Ordered delivery through uber eats none of the orders had the condiments that went with it. No utensils were included as well. But it was hot and tasted fresh. I was informed that if I wanted the condiments that I would have to come to the restaurant myself to get them.	The appletinis and the appetizers were good and delicious. The bar has lots of space and picnic table seating, they serve all kinds of drink. Food there were pretty good, menu has nice twist with flight theme. The burgers, cheesy fries and pretzel with cheese are good as well.	For any South Carolina game, this is the place to be. The bands were amazing. The steak fries with rueben were absolutely awesome. Great place for date nights or parties. The food is quite good for bar food, it's hot and tasted fresh.  The Appletinis has the perfect amount of alcohol and sweetness. The menu has Flight themes with nice twist. Very impressed with the staff, they were on their game.	This is a good place to spend time with friends or go watch the game. They always have tons of beer on tap and the prices of drinks are reasonable. The food is standard bar food, with fun items like cheesy fries and bacon-wrapped poppers. Also, the atmosphere is great with good music.
business	qSa3L7cy8Gju4ZLs50ycag	This is like a higher priced long John silvers. Greasy fattening food, not so clean, it just shouts heart attack at the door. I had fried oysters and some sides but really would never go back. Greasy and sloppy.	Best seafood restaurant in the Charlotte area. Great selection of both healthy and fried fish. The crab legs are great and Tuesday is all you can eat crab legs. The Alaskan white fish is also great. Kids and adults love it! Our fav family restaurant!	The food is real bad. Actually I didn't realize that the fish I ate was no good and became very sick from it. Also don't get the oyster soup I took one lick and sent it back. It's like eating watered down butter with oysters incorporated into it. Highly highly highly recommend CAPTAIN D's;)	I am NOT a shellfish fan but the seafood here is really good along w / the hushpuppies! Was recommended by a person I work with and I am glad I went--and have gone several times since then. Just be sure to get there early or be prepared to wait in line.	I don't eat seafood, but they have great chicken and steak for anyone who doesn't like seafood! The place looks very cool on the inside as if you are at the beach. The hush puppies are to die for!!	I had the filet of perch and fried oysters and man... They were great! Great portion size for 14 bucks. Even though I got fried it wasn't greasy. I got it to go but the place looked pretty cool to eat at! The fries and hush puppies were good. I will return.	It's been awhile since I have been here, but the crab legs were always fantastic. Family friendly restaurant with the best service. The complimentary hushpuppies are delicous and fresh. If you want good home cooking and delish seafood or fish, I will always recommend this place!	Awesome fish camp. Portions are very large even with the small ones. The food is amazing! There always super busy so be ready to wait especially on the weekends. We call in a lot to and the staff is always nice and very efficient.	The seafood here is great, especially filet perch, fried oysters, and the crab legs on Tuesdays. For the ones that don't like seafood, there is also chicken and steak. The portion sizes are generous and the hushpuppies are always an excellent choice. Besides the food, the staff are also friendly and quick.	The all-you-can-eat crab legs special on Tuesdays is a huge draw for this restaurant. Portions for other dishes are very fair for the money and it's really hard to resist the fresh and delicious complimentary hushpuppies. The oyster soup is not great though, and most of the menu is heavily fried and unhealthy. The decor creates a beach-like feel and the staff is great. The restaurant is family-friendly, too. However, this place is almost always busy, so expect a wait time at the door.	Long wait times to get food. Great restaurant for the family. Portion sizes are big and the food is delicious, if not somewhat fattening and unhealthy. Has a atmospheric inside of the restaurant that feels like being at a beach, though it can get very crowded sometimes. Overall highly recommended restaurant.
business	rkF_WvWIHqM1TfYtoPTvNw	Great lunch place, with reasonable prices. The Sushi Rock combo is good and will fill you up (soup, salad, nigiri and a spicy salmon roll for around $15.) It's on the same block as Absolute Comedy, which makes it a great place to take a date for a pre-show dinner.	Good food. Great service good price. I and my family been here one a month. For 2 years clean. Quiet. Cozy But not too much food if you like quiet and cozy this place good for you. Come to try	All the sushi we ordered tasted great. According to my Japanese friend with me, he said that the quality of the sushi was pretty good. The service was decent and the servers were as friendly as they had to be. Overall great experience for a guy who does not have sushi too often.	My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by the great quality of sushi from Sushi Rock. The standout items for me were the Four Seasons roll, barbecue eel and the Crunch roll. I'm giving a 4 star because there is room for improvement but regardless, it's definitely my new favorite neighborhood sushi place!!	Sushi is fantastic for the price, which is very reasonable for the neighbourhood, service is great, portions are large and the selection is fantastic! They are great with kids and very flexible about menu substitutions. Try some specials instead of the all-you-can-eat, I recommend the torched sushi!	Subpar sushi, but good serving sizes for the price we paid. Took a while for service to come to us, even after asking several times. Ordered a Coke, and it didn't come until we asked again. But it's sushi, and sushi is good.	I like this restaurant and I'm regular comustomer.Every time I go there I gave the tip over the% 15 but i won't give them a tip anymore.I knew that the servers can't get the tip.Their wage is just $12- $14 / hour including a tip.It was shocked.You don't need to give the tip for servers.	Not the greatest sushi option around this area. The restaurant looked dated, and the food was not the best. I ended up feeling a little sick after eating here. I mostly ate sashimi, so maybe the fish was not in its best condition, or was not fresh enough.	Sushi Rock has decently high quality sushi rolls and the service is acceptable with room for improvements. The pricing of the food is good for its quality and the location is relaxing in an area with a selection of entertainment options close to the restaurant.	While this spot isn't the best of sushi places around, the prices are reasonable and the customer service is very good. The restaurant itself is a bit outdated but nonetheless clean and it fits the atmosphere. The portions are enough to fill up someone who is very hungry. It is a great quiet spot for anyone to enjoy when a sushi craving strikes.	This sushi restaurant is pretty good. The sushi itself is good, though not great. The prices are also pretty good, and the serving size is pretty large for the price. The service is friendly and competent. It isn't the best restaurant around, but overall is recommended.

business	thYC66m1cYM-uQSkMQePZQ	Are you kidding me? I was disappointed after seeing all the good reviews. It is fast food BBQ. If you want a McRib and McDonalds is not Serving them go here. Do not go here if you want real BBQ. This place sucks!	Fast and Friendly service! Absolutely delicious!! Seriously finger licking good! The ribs fall right off the bone and they are juicy. I can't wait to go back and try the other items. They also have a daily special every day and it includes sides and a drink.	I went in today and everyone was so nice and with a great attitude. Ive been here before and never had any issues, but today it was just great! Makes a difference when you see the workers in a good mood.	3rd Visit within a week. We have been so impressed with the food and staff that we took a friend. We tried something different and once again were very happy that we did. No Question we will be back, and soon if I have anything to do with it.	Both times Ive been there, lunch and dinner, they had lines out the door... Free Ice cream, excellent meat, sides, and rolls. Gotta try it to believe it... Dont throw out your yellow cup, refills are only 99 cents on future visits!	Not that bad for a chain. I prefer their Texas style brisket and the pulled pork. The Jalapeno beans are pretty good too. I haven't had them yet but the baby back ribs looked amazing. I also really like their spicy BBQ sauce!	I have to commend someone from Dickey's BBQ apologizing and asking for my contact information. However, no one ever contacted me and it has been a week. If you're going to follow-up with a customer, do it. I'm so disappointed.	Good stuff. It's a national chain, so the menu items, sauces and meats should be consistent from one location to another.That said, what they offer is tasty, authentic bbq. Yum! They even offer big, goofy yellow plastic cups with discounted refills for repeat visits.You can't go wrong with Dickey's BBQ.	Meat, rolls and sides is excellent, ice cream is free. Friendly and fast service,  absolutely delicious. The ribs are juicy. The Jalapeno beans are very good too. Everyone was very nice and had a great attitude. Very impressed with the staff. They offer big, yellow plastic cups and refills at reduced cost for repeated visits.	This chain BBQ place offers fast food style BBQ food. They have a variety of good menu options of meats, sides, and sauces, including ribs, brisket, and pork. They also allow refills on future visits if a customer saves their yellow cup for a return trip.  Overall this place is recommended.	Dickey's BBQ is a national chain of BBQ that offers excellent meat, sides and rolls (with spicy sauce) and free ice cream with discounted refills. The staff are efficient and very friendly. Overall a very recommended place.
business	tuCLe8Rose9TzqDw21ycIA	The food is so good and so fresh we had to come back two days in a row. Although their menu is very simple, it is very delicious and satisfying. Do not forget to ask for some lava sauce. Its not teriyaki sauce or bbq sauce. It's lava sauce because it is made with lave (love).;)	Food tastes good, i had the chicken box, which is grilled chicken with white rice and steamed vegetables. This is a great spot to stop grab a great meal and go about your day. I'll definitely be back and recommend this business.Good place for a quick meal, nothing fancy but adequate.	Cheap, tasty meal! Very happy I tried this place. I ordered grilled chicken with brown rice and veggies. Total bill was under $5.00! Definitely worth a visit and I may have found my go-to lunch place!:)	Ate here yesterday afternoon. We both had chicken on noodles with veggies. We both enjoyed it and felt it was good value for reasonable price.Owner was friendly and restaurant was clean. I like when I can see my food being prepared and here you can.I live 4 miles away so I will definitely be back.	Best grilled teriyaki chicken, beef, salmon, pork, and short ribs in town and the prices are amazing. There's not enough praises I can say to this establishment. Very friendly staff. I highly recommend this place to everyone.	Great food, great owners! I got the chicken bowl and my wife got the beef bowl both were great. The taste reminnds me of ha ing those bbq cookouts out in hawaii. One thing i would buy is a shirt cuz i like the logo and the place.	The food here is surprisingly good and flavorful. The best part is that it is highly affordable. I paid about $5 for a full meal. It does take a while for them to cook it, so be sure to call ahead to place your order.	LAVA GRILL!!!! Where do i start....... The food is great, service is good. The food is fairly priced and very very flavorful. You get to choose between white or brown. 1.50 for extra meat. The lava sauce is delicious. I would recommend anybody to come here. Good place for lunch or dinner.	The food here tastes amazing, and at these affordable prices these deals can't be beat. There may be a bit of a wait as the food has to be prepared and cooked, but that means it's fresh when served. One particular popular dish that can't be recommended enough is the grilled chicken.	Great restaurant, offers remarkably affordable grilled meat with a special 'lava' sauce. The menu is simple but adequate, delicious and flavorful. Atmosphere is clean and the staff and management are warm, friendly and courteous. Highly recommended place.	The value of the menu choices is very high, along with the food being very flavorful. They offer various choices including chicken, beef, salmon, pork and ribs. Service is good and quick, making it a good spot for a quick lunchtime stop. Larger orders may require more time for them to finish.
business	v3AXp8DPMgwpy4DX4DDZNw	I had tried to fix a leaky outdoor faucet and I had bent the pipe pretty bad. They did a great job cutting off the bent piece and replacing with a sturdy fix. I had already purchased the parts needed so they charged me fair price for the work. Glad that I found an honest and dependable plumber. Thank you.	Came out same day to fix my AC. Very polite and respectful. Will need to come out again to fix the issue completely since I had guests that I didn't want to disturb, but made a big improvement quickly without a big mess.	We needed a bathtub drain replaced. I called and they came out the very next day. Jason was our tech and he was professional and very nice. He arrived on time and did a fabulous job! I would recommend this company to anyone needing any plumbing assistance.	My experience with ASAP plumbing was top notch. They were on time and worked quickly. I needed a water softener, water heater, and two toilets installed. Everything was done professionally and cleanly. I would not hesitate to call them in the future.	Jason from asap came & installed new garbage disposal. He was friendly and efficient. Only glitch was he had wrong phone number for me so couldn't call first but he came within the specified time frame. No hidden costs, exactly as quoted.	I have had these guys out twice. Once for a water heater, and again for replacement of a couple of shut off valves under the sink. Both times they arrived the same day and made the repair every quickly. Very courteous and efficient!	I highly recommend ASAP. They are courteous, fair and honest about the work that needs to be done. I have called them 3 times for various plumbing fixes and they are always on time and quick. I'm happy to have found a plumber that I can rely on.	Sushi kee is the restaurant I work at.Our a.c. went out last night during business hours.This company didn't beat around the bush and went straight to the point.Even in this scorching hot weather, they personally showed me exactly what was broken and was honest to all of our questions. Thank you ASAP air conditioning	ASAP provides a variety of services including plumbing, air conditioner servicing, and garbage disposal installation.

business	wAUUgvSJqKdx6x7Lzy79Og	Bennett Medical for Cpap supplies are horrible. We have waited for three weeks to refill supplies and we are still waiting. This company does not have good customer service, you can only leave messages, and they never call back. If I could give Bennett Medical zero stars I would!	Teachers Health Trust, please look into the practice of the billing and filling of durable services. The mask cushions go for 45 to 50 days because of the lack of communication. The people in charge of billing are very argumentative and lack customer service. I will drop them after annual, because of my insurance obligations.	Fantastic service from Jocelyn at the front desk, we had a really hard time getting the right paperwork together from Drs but she stuck with us and helped us every step of the way, even calling to keep us updated and to update info we might have for her. Thanks Jocelyn.	I hardly ever write reviews, but I'd like to spare someone else from what I experienced. So a warning to the wise... If you like rude incompetent employees, almost an hour long wait for just picking up a phone order, and basically being treated like a second class citizen then look no further than Bennett Medical.	DON'T use this medical supply. Never enough staff to answer phone, so you'll need to leave messages. No return phone calls. I am unable to get my CPAP supplies every quarter without hours of calling / waiting / calling. Poor customer service. Will be moving to another medical supply as soon as I can.	Terrible experience. They have ridiculous price also bad customer services. You can get nebulizer machine around $50 at amazon, bennet medical charge you almost twice more expensive price. And breathing kit price was unbelievable too. Because of deduction, I had to pay them all out of my pocket whatever they charged. I don't recommand this medical company to anyone.	Good luck getting a phone call back or someone to answer the phone without hanging up immediately. I have called over 20 times left 5 voicemails over the last 30 days, just to refill a mask perscription. This is an ongoing issue that is beyond frustrating. Not trying to destroy this businesses name just want the owners to implement some basic customer service skills.	Always receive friendly customer service whenever we call or go into the location. My questions are always answered and I am very happy with the supplies we get from them. Great people providing a great service! Thank you for all you do!	Bennett Medical has a horrific history in costumer service and the wait time to get a proper response is unacceptable. The equipment runs double the market price and it is a hassle to contact them to get prescriptions refilled. It is highly recommended to not use their service.	Bennett Medical has poor customer service. Phone calls can take a long time to get answered and leaving voice mails tend to be fruitless. The products are overpriced and take a long time to be refilled. Using this medical supply company can be a hassle.	Bennett Medical lacks acceptable customer service. Many customers have complained that they are unable to reach staff when needed and their expectations are not met. The medical supplies offered through Bennett Medical can be found for much cheaper elsewhere.
business	xDFk4SbJiRXlUuuL1Ic6GA	Chawanmushi is the only dish that acceptable. The Katsu is too thinly sliced and dry. The consistency of the ramen is too soft (taste is ok). I could barely find the Tako in the takoyaki. I am sorry to say that Musashi is still my go to for Japanese food.	This place was absolutely amazing!! I had the tonkotsu miso ramen and ended up finishing the whole thing. The flavor was so good and that egg... mmm! I can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. I am so happy I found this place!	love the authenticity of this place! takoyaki, ramen, gyoza so delicious and flavor is spot-on. pricey but the politeness and friendliness of the staff outshines. i have taken friends here to eat and they love it, family loves it too. portion is large, you will go home very full and happy.	I've never had real Ramen before and now I can't live without it. There isn't anything on the menu that is bad (except the tea but you don't go there for the tea). I would drink the broth by the gallon if I could. I can't go a few days without going back.	Love this place!!! I had the coconut Thia ramen and my whole table tried to steal it from me-so good. My daughter got the curry chicken cutlet- yummy. I would ask for the curry on the side because this portion has more that enough for left overs and you don't want it to be soggy.	My husband and I are so happy that Yume has opened near our home! The 20 hour pork broth used on the ramen is the ultimate comfort food. This restaurant is fabulous. We are looking forward to trying other dishes. The restaurant and the very friendly and helpful owners exceeded our expectations.	Best ramen in NC. Took a two hour drive from Raleigh to try this place. Owner is from SF and worked at SF Japan town ramen place before. The soup base is the real stuff, not fake powders like other places. Will come back again for sure.	Awesome ramen. We tried the Shio ramen and miso ramen; both were made very well. Agedashii tofu and pork curry bowls were equally tasty. Prices are not cheap but aren't outrageous either. We met the owners, they're a very nice couple. We'll definitely be back.	This has authentic Japanese dishes with amazing flavors. There are a variety of dishes like real ramen soups that are made well and taste delicious. The dishes are pricey but the portions are large so it's worth it. The staff is also friendly and polite. Overall, a great place to eat.	This ramen centered restaurant offers wonderfully delicious ramen. Made from real, fresh ingredients, the ramen here is close to that of Japan's, especially since the owner worked at a ramen restaurant in Japantown in San Fransisco. There are many varieties of ramen to choose from. The staff are all polite and friendly when servicing.	This is an absolutely amazing place. The miso ramen has a very nice flavor and was awesome. The portions were huge. There wasn't anything bad on the menu. The prices was not cheap but weren't outrageous either. The staff were very friendly and polite.

Our food was delicious, dim sum were all very fresh and the wines were great too. Would thoroughly recommend.	Dim sum was on point! Service was ridiculously slow. Prices are reasonable, but may be considered expensive if you're comparing dim sum from SGV aka Chinatown suburb of LA. Would try it again if I was in the area, but nothing to come or if your way for.	Came on a Tuesday afternoon. Plenty of seating. Wanted some good dim-sum. Our server was Tony. Very attentive. The tripe wasn't what we were used to, but otherwise it was all very delicious. It's a bit pricey plus the taxi fare since it's further up the strip.	We enjoyed Dim Sum here recently with friends who are regulars. Everything was quite good, the ambiance was a little sterile and unwelcoming, but I think that is the case at most dim sum places. I did like that they bring you the dishes as you order them, rather than wheeling a cart around. We LOVED the steamed pork buns!	I really like the food at Pearl Ocean. The food is dim sum style but without the cart. The food was very delicious. We got to sit at a booth which I really liked because it was intimate.Customer service is really good. Try this place! Tony and Maritsa were excellent!	The dim sum is similar to the dim sum found in the better dim sum restaurant in San Jose, Ca area. The dim sum was freshly made and service was attentive and fast. We liked it enough to return the next day. It is one of the better dim sum restaurants in the Las Vegas area. Also, parking is very easy and free.	This place is okay for dim sum. It was not too pricey and locals get a discount so make sure to ask for the locals discount. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but if I'm on the strip and in the mood for dim sum it's worth trying. Overall it was really fine.	Awesome selection of dim sum for lunch, service is fast and friendly. Seems like I'm there everyday having lunch. Dinner service is equalling great from authentic Chinese dishes to live seafood you can pick right from the wall of tanks. If you like hot tea don't forget to ask for their wide variety and enjoy!!!	The dim sung was very good.  Food is a little pricey compared to other places, but not too bad. The service is very good and helpful. The waiter Tony is particularly attentive to the needs of customers.   Overall the food is good and this restaurant is recommended.	Good place for a dim sum with prices ranging from average to above average (locals get a discount). Attentive and efficient staff, a good place for lunch with great dinner options as well. Service is average in terms of speed. Overall a recommended place.	Lunch and dinner service is fast, friendly, and excellent. The dim sum was good and freshly made. The prices were reasonable and there was plenty of seating. The waitstaff and customer service is really good, as well. Overall, this place is highly recommended.
business	ypSAad4wGe3Uh0N6dgVxaw	Mgr Dave and salesman Kevin Campbell made the deal very easy for me.!!! My family really loves the car... First Porsche e hybrid I have had .Great car...... modern car tech at its bestGreat experience .I look forward to many more deals with them.Kevin Campbell one of the best salespeople I have experienced in 40 years of buying cars .Bravo Kevin!!	Family has purchased a total of 3 purchases within the last 10 years here and the service has been more than excellent. We had an issue with one of the cars, and they fixed it and allowed us to drive a newer model while ours was in repair.	This was my first experience at Porsche North Scottsdale and couldn't have been better. Kevin was clear in his explanations and communicated as he said he would. I am very happy with the Macan I bought even having had one service experience to install window tinting. Got taken with efficiency, no waiting, car ready on time. Great customer service all around.	Excellent dealership that Prides itself on service and attentiveness. No pushy pressure sales they just want you to be happy and find the car of your dreams. If you're in the Phoenix Scottsdale area I would definitely check this place out plus they do not nickel and dime you as bad as other Porsche dealerships I've been to. Mark Siffert is your go-to salesman.	The salesman Ian was too good to take my Porsche code to see exactly what I wanted. He cut me off continuously. Is it too much effort to listen to a customer that will be spending over $150,000 for a car. Shame on you Porsche, customer service needs to be better. I have come to expect more from a Penske company.	Just bought a Porsche Panamera s and absolutely love the car! I wish I would have bought one sooner. Owned high end Lexus, Audi, BMW and Mercedes and I like this car best.Got a fair deal and the sale consultant Mark Siffert made it easy and painless. Overall an excellent experience!	The best customer service ever! My son wanted the experience of riding in a 911 Turbo. We had the nicest salesman, named Nick, took us for a one of a kind test drive and made my son's day! Absolutely the coolest salesman ever!	Kevin Campbell exceeded my expectations! His knowledge of both new and used cars at the dealership was amazing. This was my first purchase at this dealership and won't be my last. My experience in buying was hassle free and professional. Thank you!	This is a great Porche dealer, highly recommended. The salesmen are knowledgeable, friendly, and are not pushy. The car buying process is easy, and the customer gets a fair deal with little or no hassle. When service is needed, the service is done quickly, and the service personnel are professional.	Great experience, no pushy pressure in their dealings. Their sales men are the best, their knowledge of both used and new cars at the dealership was outstanding. The customer service was great all around.  In general, buying was hassle free and professional.	This car dealership provides high quality customer service. The car salesmen are attentive and do their best to find the most suitable car for their customers. The majority of the customers here have been satisfied with their purchase, and many are now loyal to the dealership.
business	zHAR8MmCbjrkNnLGm1ozEQ	The food is good, the place is clean, and the staff is friendly. I became an instant Rivas fan after trying what I think is the best chicken burrito in town. Make sure to try the avocado sauce too! Yum! The carne asada fries are an excellent choice as well.	Goes to show that just because a restaurant has a high rating, doesn't necessarily mean it is great. Three stars because the food was edible. Ordered the chicken fries, cheese quesadilla and a carnitas torta. The three of us thought the food was bland and the meats dry. It's okay, but not great.	This place is very delicious. I've had the chicken tacos, chicken quesadilla, and the California burrito and they were all very delicious. The horchata and jaimaca are also very good! I definitely recommend this place, don't ever go back to Roberto's!	Food was good but a little expensive for a dive. $7.99 for a chicken quesadilla, no rice or beans. Friendly service, Tv was so loud it was uncomfortable, staff didn't seem to mindAs I'm eating a overwhelming smell of pinesol cleaner overtook the taste of my food. Between loud TV and cleaner, I won't be back	The wife and I moved to area from San Diego. Heard good about this place. The food looked great. We got our order and it was cold. Such a big disappointment. I will continue to look for a 'good spot'	Came here for the steak fries after reading the reviews. Food was served quickly and everything tasted pretty good and seemed fresh. The portion size was crazy--way too much to eat. I definitely want to come back and try some of the other menu items.	Ordered through Uber eats. Got 2 chicken enchiladas, pastor fries, plain nachos, and a large sprite. The enchiladas and fries were good. But the soda was unflavored carbonated water, and 'plain nachos' is just chips. I figured nachos would at least come with cheese.	Rivas mexican grill sin duda alguna lo recomiendo variedad de comida mexicana. Es una delicia. No hay algo q este en el menú que no me guste. Por la atención calidad de personal. El restaurant super limpio un ambiente agradable.	The food here is served fast and fresh, but it is a little expensive for a small joint like this. However, the portions are large. Some dishes taste a little bland and dry, like the chicken fries and carnitas torta. The service is friendly, but the atmosphere can be loud with the TV.	The portion size is very large and the value for the dollar high. The food can be low in flavor and a bit dry on some items. Customer service can be questionable, with service and atmosphere not always being high. The food is usually served quickly, although not always warm.	A clean restaurant with prices a bit above average. Food is a hit and miss in terms of taste and quality, staff is friendly and renders good service and the environment is clean. Overall not strongly recommended.
business	zJzkL4VHHksVVGepR1IAGw	I do like this place, the food is great, but the service was just brutal on our visit for our 7th year anniversary. I wanted to cut the waiter out of the equation and run our own food. What does a guy have to do around here to get a dirty martini.	Food here is really good however I will say this is not a place if you're looking for value. Portions are very small and prices are a little pricey. The quality is there though. As others were saying, the donairs are really good! Definitely order those if you haven't tried them.	Came here for brunch; it's in a cool part of Roncy. Started with the beignets and had the English breakfast for the main. The beignets were AMAZING--soooo much icing sugar, fresh out the oven, melt in your mouth good. The english breakfast was pretty standard, solid meal but nothing too mind-blowing.	My boyfriend loved this restaurant although we found that their meat platter was overcooked. Drinks were good, dessert was good. Server was personable and cool. The shawarma was just plain bad- no flavour and pretty expensive. This restaurant is creative and unique, it deserves to succeed. It just needs to fine tune it's menu a bit.	Halifax donair all the way. Back room for a reso is a must. Great space for a 8 - 12 person party. Didnt have the seafood platter but have heard good things. Same goes for the scallops. The Notorious PIG was a hit with our group.	Went to have brunch for Mother's Day and found the modern, nautical decor charming and the service very fast & friendly! Had the chicken & waffles which were the best mix of sweet & savoury with a hint of heat! The toffee crunch bar for desserts was decadent but somehow still light & airy! I'm excited to go back for dinner!	Sweet, spicy and get outta here delicious hopgoods foodliner delivers exactly what I'm after: flavour! And lots of it. Service was friendly however a bit slow for my party's liking.Sweetbreads, tuna tartare, oatcakes, and Donairs are what we tried. 4.5 stars!	The food was delicious! The wait staff really friendly and attentive. Probably some of the best I've ever had. We tried the crispy pig ear salad, oysters, donairs, Lobster Spaghetti, Cauliflower clams and crispy toffee for desert. I would definitely not leave without trying the Lobster Spaghetti.	The food at this restaurant is generally well-liked. Most of the food is very good, though some items might only be considered OK. The service, for the most part, is good, though can be slow sometimes. This restaurant is recommended overall. It is not always the best, but should not disappoint.	This restaurant provides above average food depending on taste: brunch, lunch, dinner, or dessert.  Prices can be a little high for the portions, and service can be poor.  Overall it is a good place for a meal especially for large groups of people.	The food here is amazing, especially the beignets and the toffee dessert. The service can be hit or miss but are friendly to deal with. This is a nice place that can seat a larger party. They have delicious menu options for brunch, lunch and dinner with unique and creative menu options.
business	zSQs_cDOOyjnTHREy9yRfQ	This place was ok. You can't go wrong with a variety of salsas. My burrito was good, but the rice inside lacked flavor. I was left with a mouth full of bland flavoring and had to constantly add sauces and salsa to every bite to give it taste. Price wasn't bad. Portions were nice. Just lacking in flavor and taste.	i ordered the water street with chicken. i got the water street with beef. the manager quickly fixed my order. fantastic customer service. 5 stars. follow up. my second burrito got me sick. the rice was hard and there was hardly any chicken or fillings. i have food poisoning, and i will not return to this restaurant.beware!	Went here for the first time a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed myself.Was a little confused about the ordering system. The prices are also a little much but the food was very good. Had the grilled fish tacos and the queso and they were both wonderful! Highly recommend if you're looking to get away from Chipotle or Taco Bell.	This is a nice spot that offers gluten free options. We've eaten here a couple of times- love the salsa bar (HARBANARO!!!) and the guac is pretty decent. The sidewalk patio is a great place to hang out in the summer.	After living in Tucson for many years, I am always skeptical of Mexican restaurants. That being said, they have the most authentic tacos on Kent. I have only eaten here once, but I will be back. I wish they offered margaritas on the rocks instead of always frozen. The guacamole was great and I love a good salsa and hot sauce bar.	I had a quesadilla. It was one of the best i have ever had. The staff was friendly and helpful. The frozen sangria is delicious, but quite strong. The salsa bar was a little underwhelming, but it is more than made up for by everything else. I would recommend highly!	I have eaten at Fresco three times. The first two times I didn't have any complaints about the food. The tacos are really good. The last time I ordered take out, the chicken was slightly overcooked and dry. The prices are a little high, but the service is fast. I would eat here again.	I asked the girl at the counter what was best. She recommended the pork tacos and I was very happy with them. The salsa bar is a cute gimmick, but I'd rather have one really good salsa than ten mediocre ones.	This place has a salsa bar that features a wide variety of different salsas that are very good, and also features a very good guacamole.  They have a variety of tacos, featuring different meats, that are recommended. The rice isn't very good and prices are a bit high for what you get. Overall this place is recommended.	Fresco offers good, healthy food (the tacos are especially good), and prices are above average. Food quality can be a hit and miss. Service is reasonable fast, and the staff is friendly and courteous. Overall a recommended place	The quality of the food is almost always great. The frozen margaritas and sangria are delicious. The salsa bar is hit or miss. The customer service is excellent and it quick to resolve any problems.  Genuine Mexican food.
business	zvB0Vzhomsodw_iQ7FHY1Q	This place is totally legit barbecue! Everything from the brisket to the ribs to the coleslaw and beans were absolutely amazing! And we even got a tour of the smoker. The service was every bit as good as the food, and we are coming back again	Went to West Alley BBQlast night and we were very happy to find excellent ribs. The rub used adds to the flavor of the meat. The ribs are meaty, tender and juicy.A plus is that around 7pm there's live music. We are looking forward to our next meal.	Wonderful food, must try bbq beans, crinkle cut seasoned fries, coleslaw and potato salad. My only complaint was the ice tea / sweet tea had the hint containers may not be completely cleaned well or not fresh enough. All in all I am coming back! Great bbq!!!!	OMG.... A must. We stopped by after Puro cigar lounge and had some of the best barbecue ever!! My girlfriends ribs were falling off the bone and the flavor was amazing. No knife required. The same with my brisket. Could hardly pick it up with a fork. Owner and crew very nice. We'll definitely be back.:)	This barbecue joint certainly has a lot to offer it definitely can compete with any barbecue in town or out of town. IMHO, their brisket is top-shelf and you're not like all you can eat catfish. My personal favorite is white beans I like them just like they make-im. Shane was our server the certainly prettiest helpful I highly recommend the joint	Food was terrific and the Spicy barbecue sauce was super yummy. Service was not so great. Took a long time for the waitress to take our order. Luckily we were not in a hurry. Food took a long time to arrive and the restaurant was not that busy - only about 8 tables.	The best BBQ I have had in a long time! Since living in the South!!!! They know how to serve great bbq and a southern bonus... vinegar slaw on the sand which, superb! Glad you are in Chandler!	Sadly, was not impressed. Sunday brunch, Ribs tasted as if they were left from 1 or 2 days ago. Meat was VERY burnt and DRY. I was really wanting to like this place. Potato salad tasted like store bought, and white beans tasted like out of a can. Hubby said Brisket was enjoyable so 2 stars for that.	The BBQ here is highly recommended. The ribs, brisket, and all of the sides like coleslaw, BBQ beans, and fries are delicious. The ribs in particular are full of meat and are very tender. However, it might be wise to avoid Sunday brunch as the food tends to be dry and burnt.	West Alley BBQ serve great BBQ ribs with spicy sauce. Service is great but may fall below par when there are many customers to attend to. Other dishes include white beans, brisket, fries and potato salad. Features live music in the evening, overall, recommended.	The BBQ dishes are full of flavor and very tender. They offer numerous dishes, from ribs to brisket, and many side dishes as well. Beans, fries, coleslaw and potato salad are offered and live music usually starts around 7 pm. Some dishes may not be as fresh as they could be, sometimes dry.
