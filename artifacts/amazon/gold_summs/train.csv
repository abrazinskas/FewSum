cloth	B0040EIHQQ	This pendant is so unique!! The design is beautiful and the bail is a ring instead of the typical bail which gives it a nice touch!! All the corners are smooth and my daughter loves it - looks great on her.I cannot say anything about the chain because used our own chain.:) Satisfied.	It look perfect in a womens neck!! great gift, I thought for the price it was going to look cheap, but I was far wrong. It look great.Spect great reward from your woman when you give this to her; D	The prettiest sterling silver piece I own now. I get so many compliments on this necklace. I bought it for myself from my hubby for Valentine's Day. Why not? When people ask where I got it, I simply say from my loving hubby. And he is off the hook as to what to get me. win + win.	I love hearts and I love 'love':) I do not have any negative feedback, the necklace is perfect and the charm is perfect. I just thought it would have been slightly bigger. Overall, I love my new heart necklace.	When I received the package, I was surprised and amazed because the necklace is so elegant, beautiful and the same as the picture shown here. I really love this necklace. It has a unique pendant designed. I will recommend it to someone to order it now...	Item is nice. Not a great quality item, but right for the price. Charm was larger than I expected (I expected small and elegant, but it was large and almost costume jewelry like). I think it is a good necklace, just not what I expected.	I got this as a present for my GF on Valintines day. She loves it and wears it every day! Its not cheap looking and it hasn't broken yet. The chain hasn't broken either even though it is very thin. Strongly recomend it!	Over all service has been great the only problem, I ordered a purple Mickey Mouse case for iPhone 4S they sent a black, n I felt it was to much trouble n such a small item to send back so needless to say its put back in a drawer somewhere	This silver chain and pendant are elegant and unique. The necklace is very well made, making it a great buy for the cost, and is of high enough quality to be worn every day. The necklace looks beautiful when worn bringing many compliments. Overall, it is highly recommended.	This woman's necklace makes a great gift for any woman or child. The thin sterling silver chain looks elegant and the heart shaped pendant is beautiful and unique. The necklace fits comfortably around the neck and looks great when worn. It's a good quality item for the price which is highly recommended.	This necklace is attractive, unique, and looks nice considering the inexpensive price. It makes a nice Valentine's Day gift or a gift for a child. The chain is thin but durable and should last a long time. The pendant is interesting and something different as a gift for a loved one.	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	4.0	5.0
cloth	B001QCZ3E4	This shoe is very classy and chic. The colour is rich and goes very well with almost any navy blue outfit. However, it fit me a bit snug to the front probably because my feet are a bit broader. And you do have to order the size a 1 / 2 inch bigger than you normally wear.	this shoe was picked by the 'bride to be' for her upcoming wedding this weekend. The other bridesmaids paid over $80.00 in a dept. store. I found my daughter 'bridesmaid' the exact same shoe for much less. The quality is the same. the brand is the same, the look is the same and it fits perfectly.	I love the look of these shoes and they will forever be special to me as I wore them at my wedding. Had a few cosmos right after our ceremony so did not notice any comfort issues throughout the night, but the next morning my feet felt like they had been pinched around the toe area.	These are VERY nice shoes and so pretty, but there is a rim inside the top of the shoes by my toes that rub them and could cause a blister or sore, so even though they are great to look at they are not that comfortable.	These shoes run 0.5 size small, I had to exchange and pay for return shipping. Order 0.5 size larger than you usually wear, and they won't hurt or give you blisters even around the toe. Remember - this is not natural leather, so don't hope to break in them. If you pick right size, they are very comfortable and cute.	I bought these in navy to wear in my sisters wedding. They matched my navy satin dress perfectly and were super comfortable. I wore these shoes longer than I have worn any heels. The lower heel gave me just enough height, but not to much to make me unsteady. Looking forward to wearing them again and again!	These shoes run appropriate to size (I'm a size 9), but I felt like they pinched my toes as I have a wider foot. The shorter heel is nice so you don't have to worry about tripping- but I sent them back as I didn't find them comfortable.	Great Fast Amazon shipping, and the show itself is a really nice bright yellow, perfect for that pop of color I was looking for. I'm five months pregnant and needed a comfortable shoe for a wedding and these completely fit the bill. I would buy again.	These shoes are best fit and nice looking for parties or specially for wedding functions. The toe of the show can be a challenge for some feet and may make the feet sore due to the rim to keep the shape perfect. Overall price wise and looks are great and would recommend for long term use.	These chic shoes have a short heel and are perfect for weddings. They can cause pinching and blisters, but that is easy to fix by purchasing a half size larger than normal. They come in a variety of rich colors. For the quality, the price can't be beat!	These women's dress shoes look nice and have vibrant colors. They have a lower heel, which gives more stability. However, they sometimes cause toe pinching and rubbing if worn to size, so ordering a half size larger may be required. These shoes are not recommended for wide feet for this reason.	4.0	5.0	4.0	3.0	4.0	5.0	3.0	5.0
cloth	B005BQ6YYO	Fit as expected. Have trouble with my feet: neuromas, plantar fasciitis, and bunion. Looking for comfortable cushioned for quick trips to run errands without putting on sneakers and sneakers. These work great for me but not for all day use.	The shoe is so comfortable and I bought another 'walking' shoe by Ahnu which is perfect too.Needed a cute and comfy shoe to do lots of walking in Europe this Spring. These will fit the bill.I found this style was a little big so I had to get a half size smaller and it is great.LO	Reviews said to buy a size smaller. I wear a 7 so ordered the 6.5. It was still too big, and I'm guessing a 6 would fit. I bought the Ahnu sandal at 6.5 and it fit perfectly. I plan to reorder the shoe but in a size 6.	I always take a 7 or 7.5, in fact own a pair of flipflops from this brand in a 7, decided to order 7.5 and it fits more like a 8.5 or even a 9. Way too large. Am returning & hope to replace with a smaller size.	I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe with some style. I can wear these instead of sneakers for less casual events. The shoes run big. I normally wear a 7 1 / 2, but ended up with the 7 which fit just right.	I ordered these shoes in a half size smaller than my regular size due to reviews that I read, but they were still too small. They were pretty shoes, so was very disappointed. The company was very good about refunding my money very quickly.	I don't believe these shoes will fit anyone who wears a narrow. If I order my true size, they're too short and my toes hit the front of the shoe yet if I order the next size up they're too wide yet my toes still hit in the same place. Both pairs went back -- bummer!	I am in and out of areas where the footing can be slippery. I wanted a cute but totally functional shoe and this is it. Incredibly lightweight! I bet I could run in these. Great all around casual working shoe.	"This is the perfect ""comfy shoe,"" great for walking around town or casual get togethers. Cute and functional!  They do run a bit big, plan to order them 1/2-1 size smaller than usual. Another very comfortable shoe by Ahnu, would definitely buy again!"	A comfortable, stylish, casual walking shoe. When doing a lot of walking this shoe is a great alternative to sneakers. However, the sizing is off. They run too large and too wide. Sizing down 1 or 2 sizes allows for a better fit. The company will replace or refund quickly due to sizing issues.	These are very comfortable, quality shoes that can be worn casually. They are functional and incredibly light-weight. However, the shoes tend to run a bit large. Overall, this quality product is recommended.	4.0	5.0	4.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	3.0	4.0
cloth	B0052PKEYK	Although the quality of construction seems adequate, the sizing isn't accurate. I ordered a size 34 which is the size I normally wear and the suit not only pinches around my legs but also is almost uncomfortably tight around the waist.	The suit seemed ok in quality however it was the wrong size. It is always a gamble buying online even following the sizing chart. I did return it and got a refund but Amazon failed to fight for the sale and make it right. I went to a local store and purchased what I liked.	Fits well and has a nice draw string to keep them tight. I bought a size small so that I would not have to worry about them falling off but I should have bought my correct size as they fit true to size.	The only reason for the 1-star reduction, is the seams around the legs are pretty stiff and tight. However, the seams appear to be loosening up a bit though with use. I typically wear a size 32 but had to get a 34 for this suit.	The size on the waist was correct, but if you have large thighs like I do, or should I say muscular thighs, it will be a tight fit. It is very tight to get past my thighs, then it wasn't so bad. The waist was a 38, no problem there. It will be a tight fit on most guys.	I got this swimsuit a month ago. I swim 5 days a week for about an hour and 15 min. I washed the suit after every practice. It tookabout 2 weeks for a fabric to loose all elasticity. After two more weeks the suit basically fell apart. Avoid!	I wear a 32 and I read some of the reviews and yes it does have a nice feel and fit but does run small with that being said I ordered a 34 and it was a nice fit and feel but I think a 36 would have been a better fut	I haven't swam in it much yet but fit is good. I bought two different styles. Both were speedos. I am not a swimmer so this is a first purchase of speedos. Training for my 3rd marathon and wanted to add swimming as part of my workout.	The quality/construction seems to be decent.  However, the sizing can be problematic and isn't super accurate about the leg opening and waist.  Sizing up one, or even two sizes in some cases, might be a good idea, especially for muscular thighs.	The suit tends to run a bit small as the fitting in the waist was adequate but it was tight in the thighs. After heavy use the seams tend to loosen up and even loose the elasticity over time. Overall it's a nice suit, has a nice feel, and is nicely constructed.	The material used to make this product is of high quality. This is a very durable product that comes in various sizes and styles. The product can fit snugly around the body. It is important to go up one size to ensure proper fit. Overall, this product is highly recommended.	2.0	2.0	5.0	4.0	3.0	1.0	4.0	4.0
cloth	B0013EQ20Y	i really like these boots. they can be a beast to get on, like any boot fit to last; once on, they are incredibly comfortable. I have had them for 4 years and they still look great - worn in but not worn out...	What great boots! They do take some breaking in - like all real leather does. Run maybe a tad small in the general spectrum, but hey, remember the break in period. Look fabulous, will last me for the next twenty years.... They bridge the fashion vs. function quandary beautifully.	Every woman needs a pair of these Frye boots! Fit is true to normal size. I wear a standard 9. These fit in the shaft for any ladies who have bigger calves as I do. You have to fight to get them on first few times and they wear stiff until fully broken in. Worth the money and break in time.	Boots excellent quality, beautiful skin, a modern model. But! they are very narrow! This is the second pair of shoes is a brand and my 8.5 size fits me perfectly, even he little more than usual. But these are very narrow! go to a cobbler, let him try to stretch. Be careful!	bought these for the wife to have something to kick around in and keep up with the kids, but she doesn't like them. Her heel lifts with every step, and they're stiff and heavy. Not an everyday casual shoe.	Don't get me wrong, they're really good boots, but they used to make them better. My last pair from a few years ago were much higher quality. Thicker sole, better full grain leather, now they only make the black in 'grease', which stains all my socks black. Keeping them, but still disappointed in Frye.	i bought it just for the heavy snow cuz my UGG got wet through.even though it is a little expensive, but the boots are nice and it was shipped to me for only two days.!!!!!! i love it	They were comfortable the moment I put them on. The sizes are exact. The color the way they are made are what I expect from Frye which I've been wearing since the 70's. With a 20year break from not wearing Frye it was a pleasant surprise the quality has stood the test of time.	These boots look amazing and are made of great quality leather that lasts for many years without looking worn out. They can be a bit stiff until they're  broken in but once they have they're extremely comfortable. They are however tough to put on and the fit is a little narrow.	This is a great pair of durable leather boots. They are high quality, good looking and rugged. These leather boots will last for years. They can be stiff in the beginning but will loosen up once they are broken in. These are a great looking pair of boots that are highly recommended.	These Frye boots are sturdy, heavy boots appropriate for snow. As real leather boots, they may feel stiff at first and require a break-in period before they are fully comfortable. Once broken in, they should last a long time, as Frye has a long history of making these durable boots.	4.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	2.0	3.0	5.0	5.0
cloth	B006QM4HOG	I really appreciate the method of safety built into this bag. But, it is so large that by the time you put all of your stuff in it, it is hard to carry. Certainly could not carry as a cross bag easily. If someone jerked the bag, it is so big and strong, the person might jerk me down to ground!	it is light weight and has many compartments. I wish it was just a little larger. There is a 400 item which is too big-rhis is a 200 item which is fulls up fast; therefore; I would like to see the company make a 300 series.	I love this bag although I would have preferred it to be a litle smaller. It is light enough that I can carry my camera, camera accessories, as well as all my normal purse items including my Kindle. I love this particular shade of blue. It goes well with most everything I wear. I also appreciate the pockets for separating things.	Took this bag on a recent trip to Europe and it was great. No worrying about theft and it is filled with pockets to accomodate all things that you need to take for a day trip. The two outside pockets were great to hold a water bottle or umbrella.	I checked this on two different monitors before I ordered. Both looked more rose color. It's very much a dark purple. Which I'll live with since it is for travel, and didn't care about it being subtle it's very large, we'll see how well it hold up	Wish it came in colors but other than its drab appearance it is an AMAZING bag. I couldn't believe how much stuff I got in there on a recent trip. Comfortable to wear with handy pockets and clips in all the right places. Love this bag.	I used this for the first time last week on a trip to Maine. We normally drive so I was worried about carrying things on the plane. This handled my camera, binoculars, medicines, treats, glasses and cosmetic case along with two paperback books and three drinking cups. I love it!	This is the purse for all to have when you have children or you need to have it while traveling on trips! Seriously, great purse and yes, I paid a little bit more for the mauve as I was tired of black. I just love my purse!	This is a durable high quality bag. It's large enough to carry many items and has versatile pockets, both inside and outside. It's a great bag for traveling and can easily hold a full days worth of items. The bag is lightweight and comfortable to carry. This bag is highly recommended.	This bag is large and can hold many items easily. The bag has various compartments which help to keep items organized. It is useful when traveling as it can be worn across the body for safety. It is offered in a variety of colors and is highly recommended when a large bag is needed.	This purse/bag has plenty of pockets to carry a lot of items. It is recommended for carrying a lot of things on a trip or for using with children. In fact, the bag may be considered too big for general carrying by some.The colors are fine, but not spectacular.	3.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0
cloth	B005DO7R3G	I usually wear size 37, but found a 38 feels better in this sandal. I absolutely love this sandal. So supportive and comfortable, although at first I did get a blister on my big toe. Do not let this be the deciding factor. It stretched out and is now fabulous. I love it so much that I bought it in three colors.	This is a really cute shoe that feels very comfortable on my high arches. The strap on the instep fits my feet very well, but I have very slim feet. I can see how it would be uncomfortably tight on anyone with more padding on their feet.	I love these sandals. The fit is perfect for my foot, with perfect arch support. I don't think the leather is cheap, and the sandals are very comfortable to walk in. They are very pretty, and pair very well with pants and dresses.	My wife is a nurse and wears dansko shoes. We were excited to try the new crimson sandal and normally order 39 sandal and 40 closed toe. Some other reviews were right about a narrow width and tight toe box. We gave them a try and passed a great pair of shoes to our daughter with her long narrow feet, and she loves them...	Finally, a Dansko sandal that's fashion forward! It was love at first sight! This is my 4th Dansko purchase. Their sizing, quality and comfort is very consistent. I love the stying of this sandal and I'm pleased they are offering bolder colors. Another feature I love is the Dri-Lex topsole - it's soft and keeps feet dry.	I really love these sandals. my only issue is after wearing them for a while my feet started to swell as I have a high instep and they were a little tight across the top. I'm sure they will stretch a bit after a few wears	I have several pairs of Dansko clogs that are all size 39 and fit perfectly. So I felt confident when I ordered the Tasha Sandal in size 39. I don't know if a 40 would be too large but the 39 seems a little small. Otherwise, I love them. They are very cushiony and comfortable!	I own many Dansko shoes and these are among my favorites. They have ALL the support that Dansko offers in its shoes plus they are very attractive. I love the the heel height and instant comfort. They look great with slacks and dresses, dressed up or not...	The Dansko sandals are very comfortable and provide great support for the feet. They look great, fit the latest fashions and the sizing is consistent throughout the Dansko brand. These sandals may be uncomfortable for those with a wider foot but they fit narrow feet well. Overall, a high quality sandal which is highly recommended.	These Dansko sandals are attractive and high quality. This sandal runs a size small and has a tight toebox. The toebox stretches after using it and then is very comfortable. The sandal is most comfortable for narrow feet. The heel height is great and they look nice with casual and dressy outfits.	This company has created many different styles of shoes from clogs, to sandals. The clogs can often run large and have a narrow fit but will stretch out with consistent use, and are very comfortable. The sandals are fashionable and comfortable but may also require some breaking in to get them to fit just right. Both styles of shoes offer great support, and quality in design.	5.0	4.0	5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0
electronics	B003YJ5LLM	Love the design of this sleeve. When I don't have a table I use the sleeve as a mat to protect my thighs from the heat of my laptop. Wish it had a bit more padding and cushion but other than that it's a pretty carrying sleeve.	This was bought for our teen daughter for Christmas, the only negative things about it are 1.no strap 2.no pockets, other than that it is great, but in all fairness i knew both things about it when ordered, it came in very fast, was just as described, great item for the price.	This case fits perfectly on my 14inch hp. I disagree with the comments that talk about the smell being terrible. The smell really wasn't that strong and went away after a couple of weeks. I love the design and it was a fair price. Shipping was a little expensive though. It arrived quickly and I would buy from this seller again.	I really enjoy the design of this case but I thought it would be lighter. When it came, it was a very dark grey which was a bummer. But the quality is good and it has a nice thick padding to protect my laptop.	I like this case very much! It fits my Acer Aspire 14 'as a glove!!! Yes, it smells a little bit but I wouldn't say that it's so bad as mentioned in some reviews. And it's very cute too. I recommend this product to anyone.	I BOUGHT IT FOR MY ACER 14 ', IT IS A LITTLE BIT TIGHT, BUT THE WORST WAS IT HAS HEAVY RUBBER SMELL, WHEN I LEAVE THE CASE IN MY ROOM, THE RUBBER SMELL WAS FILLED WITH THE AIR EVERYWHERE OF MY ROOM, MADE ME SICK. DON'T BUY IT.	I have a dell inspiron 14, and the cover is a little snug. It's working well though and now I can carry my laptop in my school backpack rather than carry a separate laptop bag. I'd recommend this product, just do a bunch of research to make sure it will fit.	I really love it! It doesn't smell a lot as some reviews say and the draw is well defined.I bought this size for a 13.3 'because my laptop will have a cover on it so I don't know how it fits for a traditional 14 inch,	This laptop case has a nice, attractive design and fits laptops with up to a 14-inch display well. It doesn't have a strap or pockets, so it may be better suited for protecting the device while inside another bag rather than carrying it around on its own. It can have a slight rubber smell.	This well-designed case fits a variety of 14" laptops, but measurements should be made to make sure this is the right size. It may have a rubbery smell initially, but the smell goes away with time. Shipping is fast and reliable. Overall, this case is highly recommended at this price.	This laptop sleeve is good quality and it fits a 14 inch laptop nicely. It can have a strong rubber smell initially, but with time the smell should fade. The sleeve provides great protection from scratches and looks great. It is a good value and is recommended for laptop protection.	4.0	5.0	5.0	3.0	4.0	1.0	4.0	5.0
electronics	B003U8K0N6	This power supply gets the job done but I am concerned about how hot the charger gets after a few hours. I attached a cooling device to the power supply and has controlled the heat. Buy this with caution and monitor the temperature of the power supply.	This charger ruined my laptop. I did not have any problems with my 5month old lap top until i used this charger. Buy this from the manufacture and you will be better off. Go to ACER and bet it from them.	My charger gets hot very quick. The one pictured is not the on received. The prong fits loose in the laptop. The one pictured showed a grounded plug with an OEM Brick. The one received has a 2 prong plug and has a sticker on it stating, replacement AC Adapter, Made in China.It would be nice if the pictures represent the real items.	I recently purchased this power supply and cord to replace the OEM that stopped working. I've had it approximately 1 month and works perfectly. The cord is a little shorter than the original but that isn't much of an issue for me. I would recommend this product.	I bought this for my aspire 5532. It worked for about a week and now it won't charge at all. The fit was never snug from the start, but I was hopeful. I guess you get what you pay for. Buyer beware!	The charger arrived here very quickly! I am very thankful for that because I have online classes to work on for school. The only thing is the cord has to be placed a specific way or it will not charge so that is difficult.	Purchased the product for the corresponding laptop. The adapter made so much noise that I could not charge the computer in the office. After writing the company they took appx 5 days to get back to me and suggested that I send the product back on my dime to fix the problem. Poor product, bad customer service, I do not recommend.	I ordered this for my Acer 5532. It heats up right away and I only use it to charge the laptop, it isn't plugged in for very long. After only 2 weeks it MELTED! This is horrible and dangerous!	The charger gets very hot with use, which can be quite concerning. The fit into the laptop is often loose, which makes it unreliable. Some items delivered didn't resemble the photo online. Overall, it would be best to avoid this product and buy direct from the manufacturer.	This charger gets very hot very fast and it seems a bit dangerous. It has to be lined up a certain way to work. The charger makes a bit of noise. Customer service was not helpful. A cooling device may help with the heat but this product should be used with caution. It is an affordable option.	This Chinese manufactured charger is prone to overheating and may not provide a charge at all depending on what it is connected to and how it is positioned. There have also been complaints about noise while in use and poor customer service from the manufacturer, but apparently the shipping speed is to be admired.	3.0	1.0	2.0	5.0	1.0	3.0	1.0	1.0
electronics	B0051PJHDK	Very disappointing product...... bought it as a present and was not working.We returned it 3 times and they don't want to give you a refund. They only try you to upgrade to their newer version. Customer service is a joke. Pay $50 more for a better tablet it will save you a lot of headache.	I purchased one of these units 2 weeks ago, alas it has to be returned as the battery is defective. I purchased from Abe, s Of Maine thru Amazon and the customer service was top notch except i have to pay shipping to return it but that, s better than a $154 paperweight.	I got this tablet as a free gift, but didn't think it was this cheap! I got the tablet and had it for about 1 month. My kids used it to play games which seemed to work fine until one day about a month after having it would no longer power up. What do I do? It seems like such a waste.	Received tablet 6 days after order was made and worked fine till Tuesday Nov.15th at which time it stopped holding a charge. Worked fine when connected to power but shutdown when power was disconnected. Come on, it should last longer than 30 days. Paid $150 + for a product only lasting alittle more than 30 days.	7 'Skytex Skypad Alpha. Charging is hit or miss but mostly miss. It would have been OK if not for the charging issue. I e-mailed tech support for a charger replacement but no response from them. Hacked Netflix was working but not anymore after Netflix upgraded their system. Netflix issue is notSkytex 'fault.	This product is not worth buying. I bought 2 as Christmas gifts directly from the company. 1 doesn't work properly and the other is just junky. I tried to return the product but they are unwilling to take it back. Waste of your money!	Bought this one for my dad as a gift. Thought he would like it being that it was a tablet... just avoid the discount models, go with one you know they will like. Maybe a good fit for someone who doesn't know much about electronics.	The tablet is not the best in the world but for $150 its a good deal. I do feel bad for anyone that paid $400 + for it because its not worth anywhere near that. Id recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap tab	This tablet has numerous reliability issues. The likelihood of it malfunctioning after a month or less of normal usage is high, assuming it's not dead on arrival. Even considering the cheap price, it's still not worth the money.	Buying it at MSRP is ridiculous and in fairness, buying it at a discount presents a huge risk as well. The charging is spotty at best and the battery itself presents a lot of risks. Avoid it until they start caring about the quality.	This is a very cheaply made tablet. If the user didn't know much about electronics, it may be satisfactory, but it is still a mediocre product. Many defects with batteries have been noted, including failing to hold a charge and not powering up. Customer service is not responsive to questions or return requests. This tablet is not recommended.	1.0	3.0	1.0	1.0	1.0	1.0	2.0	3.0
electronics	B002RL8IGI	Took a long time to get and when I finally got them, they didn't seem to work to well joined up (I have 3). Also, they should have come with DC chargers, they don't seem to work well with batteries, imho.	The units work fine and the setup is described in the manual works well. The one thing that my wife and I do not like is the Audio. Sounds like you are in a box. The calling button is also a bit strange. It first beeps and then you can speak. The distance it covers is very good.	Don't waste your money on these. Although if you try hard enough you can make out what the other person is saying, the audio quality is extremely poor, as is the noise cancellation (if any), and the general sound quality. I wish I had saved the boxes. I'd be sending these back.	And the problem is having to wake the kids up in the morning to go to school. They are upstairs and I used to have to trek up and down a couple of times each morning. We put one in each bedroom, 1 in the living room and 1 in the study. Problem solved.	We use it in our office to tell another employee if they have a call on hold, but that is about all it is good for. Don't bother trying to have a conversation, clarity is too poor. I didn't realize until after the fact that I should have just bought walkie talkies. At least battery life in these are good.	I searched extensively for an intercom for my large two floor home. I selected this unit (ordering three units) and regret my decision. It was very difficult set up and doesnot work that well. I wish I could get a refund as we never use it. My search continues.	It is simple to program and operate, which is just what I was looking for. I just wish I didn't have to buy a power cord separately. I am running it on batteries right now, but I am not sure how long they will last.	I've spent hours already trying to set up my network and get this system going. The engineering leaves much to be desired. Can't get it to work as advertised. The Manual is one of the least helpful such documents I've ever seen.	This product does not come with an external charging adapter and must use batteries (not included). The usability is difficult and may require some technical ability. The item can be synced with other units in the location of installation. Shipping has been reported to take longer than expected and audio quality leaves much to be desired.	These units have poor sound quality. They can be used for one or two word interactions, but having a conversation is very difficult because the sound clarity is too poor. They are also difficult to set up and don't come with power cords. These are not good units for communicating between rooms.	This intercom is difficult to set up and the manual that comes with it is lacking in help. Audio is poor and sound quality isn't great, background noise is picked up greatly. Batteries are supplied, but a power cord needs to be purchased separately.	2.0	3.0	1.0	5.0	3.0	1.0	4.0	1.0
electronics	B004G8EKIA	I did not go wrong when I purchased this stereo receiver. tons of power pushing my system, what an upgrade from my old one, this is a real powerhouse. It pounds. Remote control, quality crafted stereo receiver for under a hundred bucks! I thought it would be good, but did not expect this. A sweet deal!	If you want just a stereo then this will do the manual is very limited. The fan is loud and the USB player will only let you go one track at a time so if you have a 100 tracks it will take time to get there. The sound is fine and is easy to connect up.	First problem I have with this receiver is you can't set the channel presets. Also the speaker wire terminals are NOT clamps and it took me a while to screw them in. The power is good and it looks durable. I don't believe you can play the tv's sound through the receiver.	I got this to replace a 20 year old stereo I had. I went by the speaker specifications when I purchased this one. When I hooked it up, this receiver pushed my 15's more than I ever heard before without messing them up. Perfection!! I recommend this to everyone!	This Amp is very inexpensive and its performance proves its quality. First, you can't play a turntable without buying a preamp. That would be ok if the sound reproduction was good. I would have settled for good. I didn't settle and returned it; you shouldn't either.	Amazon ought to be ashamed to carry this junk on their line-up. You got enough BAD reviews to open your eyes.Just reading the murdered English in their manual is enough to tell you this is made by prisoners. Just try totune to your station on the FM - hopeless. The noisy constant fan! The unreal low price should have been a warning.Shame! Charles	This sound system is worth all the money you pay for it iv never heard bass so clear and ass loud as its going tough my 12 '' and 8 '' and two 5 '' subwoofers buy this if your looking for grate sound.	The Stereo works fantastic as Amp. for laptop Or MP3 player. Radio reception is poor. Has great range of sound adjustment. I have it in my garage, with speakers all around. Use mostly for Sirius / XM radio on laptop.	This is an inexpensive stereo option. The manual is limited and is difficult to read, also the fan is loud. The radio reception is poor quality. The sound quality though is great, when listening to Sirius or when hooked up to a laptop.	This is a good item for a low price and it will get the job done. The sound is clear, loud and it's easy to connect. However, the fan can be loud. This isn't a high quality system for professionals working at home. It's only recommended for non-professionals and casual at home listening.	The low price of this stereo receiver makes it mostly recommended as a replacement for a very old receiver or as a basic receiver for hooking up MP3 players or computers. It does have decent sound, though audiophiles and radio listeners should steer clear, as the hookups are basic and the radio reception is poor.	5.0	3.0	3.0	5.0	1.0	1.0	5.0	3.0
electronics	B00DB94FB2	The only thing I would like to see is an aux cord when I don't want to charge my phone, but It's not a huge deal. The sound is great, and worth the money. The remote works with your phone, and that's precisely what I wanted	you need to buy an adaptor for Ipod Nano's so it was disappointing when my son opened it up on Christmas and could not use it for his Ipod Nano. It does not state that anywhere on the box or when I ordered it.	Love, love, love the ability to save multiple preset radio stations, and the sound is clear, crisp... amazing! It almost makes waking up a pleasure. Another feature I never thought I wanted, but really appreciate, is the ability to set the brightness of the clock readout. Brilliant!	The sound of the radio is of real quality. I also like having the two separate alarms and the alarm is not obnoxious yet still wakes us up. My wife charges her iphone on it regularly and works out well. We like the Sony so much I got one for my son and his wife for a Christmas present	I was looking quite awhile to locate a decent sounding radio / iPod player which would also charge my iPod. This is perfect for our family. It's a lot smaller than I thought, which is good. And when we update to an iPhone 5, there is a $5 adapter to get so we can still use this radio. Perfect!	As always, Sony has a 'winner' in this combined am / fm radio and docking station. Great sound, looks good and wife is very pleased as she put it in her craft work area. Finding the combo of am / fm wasn't easy either.Lots of fm only units. This is a great product.	My husband really like this speaker... LOVE IT! Its so easy to operate by setting the alarm.. I like the way when you put your iphone 4s to the dock its charge at the same time while you are you using it...! Great product	While I like the Dream Machine I don't know why there's so much static. It's nearly impossible to get a couple of my favorite radio stations without constant static in the background. My other radio doesn't do that. I've even tried different locations for it. That's a big disappointment and shortcoming of the product.	This FM/AM radio, iPhone docking station and alarm clock is a perfect combination! The sound is amazing, the alarm clock is not annoying, and the design looks great! It would be nice to have a place to use an aux cord and certain apple products require a $5 adapter to use the docking station but other than that, this product is fantastic!	The Sony product is great and the radio have high quality speaker. It is also packed with the capacity to charge other gadgets. The remote control can also work with phones which makes it comfortable and a great buy. Though it can sometimes be difficult to get and switch stations with some constant static.	This Sony radio is very high quality. The sound is very clear and crisp, almost as if it's live. The charging station is very useful for charging an iPhone or iPod, but an adapter is required for a Nano. The preset stations, clock, and alarm are useful additional features that help make it a great product.	5.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	5.0	4.0	3.0
electronics	B001H9O71Q	Basic GPS unit for those of an older age who do not use smart phones. The screen is small but for the price, a very nice unit. Touch screen and color graphics are a nice touch. If you are looking for the no frills, basic navigation system, save $50 + and buy the 'One'.	I'm a novice at electronics, and there are too many processes to go thru to get to what you want (to get to your destination) - once you figure out all of the buttons to push - it's a beautiful thing...	I got this because it was a deal. I should've known TomTom has a funny way of making you forced to update maps, and in LA a lot of stuff changes so you may as well not even bother with this thing. I use this now as a back-up gps. I just hope this thing does find if and when my phone dies.	Works great. Easy to use. Sometimes may try to take you on a weird route. Still have to have an idea of how you want to get somewhere so that doesnt happen. But, it will always get you to where you want to go.	I got this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she is thrilled with it. She has her own business and must do a lot of traveling, this has been a great help to her in her travels. She is very pleased with it and I am so glad I got this for her gift.	I got a great deal on this TomTom. Not the latest technology (screen size, touch screen / talk options) but had all the features I needed (full street names big visuals). It hasn't dissappointed yet! I would recommended this to anyone.	very easy to set up and use! arrived about 2 days sooner than expected. i didn't even have to read the manual to figure out how to use it. i also like the speedometer on it (my car's speedometer isn't working).	I have purchased this nit back in 2011 and after couple month the battery kept dying.After researching this problem, it appears there is a known bug that the gps wakes up by itself and drains all battery.No firmware update ever resolved it.Avoid, not recommending, seems like a widely known issue.	Overall a great gps for the price, simple and easy to use. Makes a great gift for those not comfortable using a smartphone. May not keep up with the latest map updates, especially in a big city, so keep that in mind when using.	This GPS unit is good to have as a backup or for those who can't or don't want to use a smartphone. It does not have modern features, like touchscreen or voice control, but it does the job of giving directions to a destination with relative ease.	A basic, user friendly GPS.  With it's smaller screen and simple touch screen features this TomTom is great for the price. The color graphics and on screen speedometer are also nice features. It does require user's to update the maps, but overall, a great buy for a novice user.	4.0	4.0	1.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	1.0
health_personal_care	B005JS7KME	Got these for my 9-year-old who has really bad foot odor. I really had little confidence that these would work but needed to try something- ANYTHING- to help. And lo and behold they actually work. So well that I ordered another set for a second pair of shoes.	I love this product... 100% natural AND eliminates foot odor! While it appeared to be smaller than my 8.5 shoes, the insole fits perfectly into heels, boots, flats and running shoes. Very impressed! It has worked wonders so far! Can't wait to put this product to test this summer!	I have thick peeling, itchy skin on the bottom of one foot. I had tried everything to get rid of it. The final trick were these inserts along with slathering coconut oil mixed with athletes foot oil & oregano oil two times a day. FINALLY, normal soft feet!	The insoles fit comfortably into my shoes. I love that they are discreet and thin. I no longer have to worry about foot odor or about my shoes stinking. I definitely can see where my shoes will have a longer life by using these insoles.	Product is OK. It doesn't seem to work as well for me as was advertised. It does serve to keep your show a little dryer, but doesn't seem to work all day for me. I wouldn't recommend it as there are other options that do the same but cost less.Ok	Im sure if I were to put them in my tennis shoes they would probably fit perfectly. I am wearing them in my croc I have to wear for work. Thay are to thin width wise to really make a difference bc they tend to slide around.	This is a fantastic product that I would recommend to anyone who wants their feet to feel cooler, more comfortable, less sweaty and ultimately less smelly! They are so effective I use them in several pairs of shoes. I'm a very happy customer, thanks so much Zederna!	These insoles are so thin that I can even wear them in my pumps. They look SO much nicer than odor-eaters and work way better too. I highly recommend them. I accidentally ordered a men's 9 instead of a women's 9. It was huge but very easy to trim down with scissors. Enjoy!	This is an excellent product! Just as advertised, it eliminates foot odor and on top of that the insole is so thin it can be used in multiple types of shoes including heels. Very comfortable and well worth the price to have soft odor free feet after wearing shoes!	The inserts are effective at reducing foot odor and moisture in most cases. The thin shape makes them easy to add discretely to your shoes. Depending on shoe width, the insert may slide around a bit in wider shoes but it can also easily be trimmed to fit a narrower shoe.	These insoles are quite effective at eliminating foot odor and fit any style of shoe. They also wick moisture and are thin enough to be comfortable on any arch. The only drawback may be the price for more thrifty consumers.	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	3.0	3.0	5.0	5.0
health_personal_care	B006ZO110I	I've been using this for about two years and refilled twice. The only thing is I didn't pay attention that this one has a wand which I don't need since I have one and it is still in very good shape. I was looking for just refills. But in any way it's easy to use and works well for us.	I love these cleaners. They are easy to use and do a great job. Some people have commented they wish they had more cleaning agent, but I think they have more than enough and often use one to clean two toilets.	I love these - most practical bathroom item created - but what is going on??? Chlorox customer service advised they have discontinued! What a huge disappointment after throwing away the old brushes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	These are great because they are sanitary (unlike the scrubbers that get reused everytime). I use these for one cleaning, then throw away (without having to touch anything!) Good scrubbing action, and gets the toilet good and clean.	These are great buys. They are smaller than the regular size but well big enough to clean the toilet, much more efficient, I always felt wasting when use the regular ones and now with these, work great and well worth the money.	I have been using these for a long time, what I like about them is they are disposable and you do not have to look at a stained toilet bowl brush in the corner. Clorox toilet bowl cleaners do a very nice job.	i live in a condo and only have 1 toilet that doesn't have to be cleaned every week. so this is perfect. no clutter next to the toilet with unsightly brushes and throwing the tip away after each makes cleaning the bathroom much more palatable.	Who wants to stick their hand in a toilet? Not I! I love the wand and the refills are wonderful. NO touching required, and they scrub very well! My toilet bowl is gleaming after using these!! I'll never use anything else.	These are very useful- great for cleaning the toilet in a sanitary manner since they don't require touching it, plus the tips are disposable so they don't need to be cleaned. They are very effective, easy to use and can enhance the look of the bathroom since they make unsightly toilet brushes obsolete.	These are a very needed and practical item for cleaning. They come with refills and a wand which makes cleaning the toilet easier and more sanitary. These do a great job at cleaning up the mess and are great disposable products at a great price. No more unsightly toilet brushes clogging up the corner.	Practical, sanitary, and easy to use no-touch toilet bowl cleaner.  Smaller than regular size, but with enough cleaning power to do up to two toilets.  More efficient, and easily disposed of scrubber pad that does not clutter the commode area as old style toilet brushes tend to do.  The wand is reusable and long lasting as well.	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0
health_personal_care	B008Z8W714	I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this, but I am pleasantly pleased. The unit fits perfectly into my Zippo case, and is easy to fill and use. Once in a while it won't light but if you blow into the flame area it will work the next try.	I think Zippo over charges and I wanted to try off brand. I must say I have been pleasantly surprised and my wallet thanks me. Don't get me wrong I love classic Zippo lighters however butane torches are clean burning and are great for EDC since they have almost zero odor. The torch also adjusts very nicely so you can fine tune your preference.	got for a christmas gift and i cant say how awsome this insert is i love that the fuel wont just evaporate the flames a bit big at first and had to urn screw as how the little lever wouldnt go over far enough but again no biggy awsome product i challenge you to blow this thing out	i bought this product expecting it to last about a week, that was almost a year ago. i want to share just the facts: it plastic so don't go beating it aroundits a little small so some tape is needed to build it up and hold it in placeif you clean it right it will last for a long time	I like carrying my classic Zippo and not tainting my cigars with lighter fluid. Much cheaper to get a Zippo and this insert than to buy a Zippo Blu. I also prefer the electric ignition to the flint wheel on the Zippo Blu.	I love the old style Zippo but was having difficulty with the standard fluid and carrying the lighter around in my pocket. This made it very convenient and it's a cool 'novelty' item. I still keep most of my Zippos original (standard insert), but it's cool to have a few of these with the 'butane' conversion kit...	It did not fit properly. I then removed it and re-inserted original Zippo insert. To my dismay, cap of Zippo no longer closed properly. (Apparently, attempting to get the Thunderbird insert into the Zippo and close the cap caused the hinge to deform, rendering the Zippo unusable). Disappointing, to say the least!	Thank God I found this. It works on Butane, and it will hold fuel longer than a week. Stupid Zippo, with their flints, and their packing, and their wicks. They make a version of this with a flint, do not buy that one, buy this one. It works great. Stay away form Z-plus.	This butane conversion allows for the case of a classic Zippo to clean burning butane lighter.  It allows for flame height adjustments and holds its flame well.  It is a durable and reliable product that holds up well to wear and use. While this is not a licensed Zippo product it is important to note that its fit is not guaranteed.	This butane powered Zippo lighter boasts an electric ignition functions better than Zippo's traditional flint wheel. The size of the flame is easily adjustable with the turn of a screw, so excess butane is not wasted based on the consumers preference. The only drawback is that it may not fit some lighter cases.	This lighter insert fits inside a traditional Zippo case but doesn't use lighter fluid. It lasts longer than a traditional insert and costs less. It looks like a Zippo but works better and uses butane. The ignition is electric, not flint, and the flame can withstand wind without being blown out. Overall this lighter insert is recommended.	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	1.0	5.0
health_personal_care	B005H86LZ8	What else can be said..... this product is revolutionary. I cannot believe something so simple could be so effective and I wonder why I didn't see this myself! Kudos to the inventor. This magnet is strong and putting your glasses through the space while working is easy and just as easy to retrieve them when needed. Necessity is the mother of invention....	I saw this product on SHARK TANK and wanted it then. When I ordered it and tried it I was very impressed. The magnet is super strong and you can place it anywhere on your clothing. I bought 2 and will order more for Christmas gifts.Ellen	I wish I could use this, but my cardilogist said no.... even though I have a fairly new, high-fangled pacemaker. He doesn't have any problem with me having a cell phone in my shirt pocket, but said this magnet is just too powerful.	These little guys are amazing,, the magnetic is very strong,, your glasses will not fall out when bending over.. yeah maybe a crystal does fall out so what,, just glue it back in and it stays,, you'll always know where your glasses are,, love mine	I like it, keeps the glasses handy but when you bend over, they can fall out. So good idea, but has its limits. Perhaps if it didn't stick out as far, that would hold the glasses tighter.	ReadeRest Eye-Glass Holder-Magnet broke off after one week and I have no phone number to call the company. For the week I had it, it worked fine on my shirt but one of the front round magnets separted from the glass holding piece. A piece of junk!	Fantastic product! Ive had to order more now that ive shown to everyone. They all want one. Can be placed anywhere on your clothing and blends right in. Had people think it was part of the clothing. great gift / stocking stuffer	Great Product! Very Strong Magnet that works in holding and keeping your glasses secure. Well worth the price that I paid for it... First showing of this product was on 'Shark Tank' and it has lived up to expectations!	This lived up to expectations after the product was featured on Shark Tank. The magnet is very strong, and will work anywhere on clothing. Glasses won't slip or fall. However, those with pacemakers should avoid due to the strong magnet. Overall, recommend.	As seen on, "Shark Tank" the powerful magnet allows glasses to be placed nearly anywhere on clothing.  Glasses remain in place through normally everyday activity. The magnet blends in with clothing, so it can be used with  any outfit. A few minor pieces may come loose but can be fixed with glue. Overall, great product and a great Christmas gift.	This versatile product has a very strong magnet and can be placed in any location to safely secure a pair of glasses. It's simple to use with limitations. Bending over can occasionally cause issues and this product isn't recommended for use near a pacemaker. Overall, the product is great and highly recommended.	5.0	5.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	1.0	5.0	5.0
health_personal_care	B004U3Y9FU	These are a good value, but they're NOT burp-less. They tend to make me burp for up to an hour or two after taking them. I don't like fish, so I was terrified of fish burps, but they're actually not terrible and don't taste very 'fishy.'	Well, I've taken the first softgel capsule and given it enough time now and I can say it is, indeed, truly burp-less, unlike certain other fish oil products I've tried that shall remain nameless. If I pass away due to coronary disease, I'll consider lowering my rating of it but I'll still have appreciated its burp-lessness.	i've tried the nature made original Fish Oil before and i didn't like the fishy smell and sometimes bad burp after taste... But this Burp-less version is really better as i haven't burped and it has no fishy smell... I'm switching to this one permanently..	My husband takes 4 per day - I take 2. The price on Subcribe & Save is good. The product is consistant high quality, delivered same time each month and I don't have to go to the store to find the shelf empty. Product is worth the purchase. I know I will get the same product every month and its a good product	I couldn't handle the burping up of fish smell that other fish oil gels came with. And preferred not to use the liquid version. This gel is great. I been using it for months now--and not one burp!:)	If you are like me I like sushi but I couldnt stand the constant taste of it when I was taking regular fish oil and krill oil pills, this is why I stopped taking them. the directions said to drink a lot of water when taking them and I did but it didnt matter. I love this fish oil it does what it says..	I have been using Nature Made products for years. I feel Amazon offers them at a great price. These Fish Oil caps are the burp less variety which I would recommend to others if you take Fish Oil daily as I do. I would order them again. Also received them within a few days.	For anyone like myself who uses Omega 3 Fish oil on a regular basis, I recommend this product. This is the burp-less version which leaves no after taste in your mouth and is easily swallowed with a small amount of liquid. Stay heart healthy and take Omega 3 daily.	Burp-less Omega 3 Fish oil soft gel capsule by Nature Made.  No fishy smell or bad after taste.  Available on Amazon and Subscribe and Save at great prices.  Consistently good quality and can be ordered to be delivered monthly.  Highly recommended as an alternative to other fish oil products.	These Fish Oil softgel capsules are high quality. Regarded as good value for money and the subscription option is reliable. The capsules do not have a strong fishy smell and overall fulfil their no-burp promise. This product is highly recommended.	These are a great value and they can be taken every day. They are a great source of fish oil without the burping side effects. These burp-less fish oil capsules are easy to swallow and leave no after taste or residual fishiness that. They are a great product at a great price.	3.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	5.0
health_personal_care	B00GW5NX88	Immediately curbed my RLS. Feels great to get some sleep! Also has produced a noticeable improvement in my girlfriends mood over the last week. Cant recommend this stuff enough. Many people are deficient in Magnesium these days which can cause a whole host of problems. This pure product is definetly the most affordable and effective way to supplement magnesium daily.	It is a very good dissolving powder, i noticed that I feel much more calm and rested since using a teaspoon a day for the last 2 days... I cant give it 5 stars because of the short time Ive been taking it, but I will update this review in about a week.	I use this in conjunction with N-Acetyl L-Cysteine and TUDCA for the liver, but it has been GREAT for my arthritis! I definitely will continue to use this product. I currently take 3327 mg x d, so it is reasonably priced. Again, great product!	I purchased this to put in my Soylent mix, and I couldn't be happier. Like other supplements I've ordered from this company, the product is well shipped and the resealable bag is easy to store. I also like how concentrated it is, and how little I need to use to supplement my diet.Couldn't be happier.	I have been taking Magnesium supplements for a number of years. Magnesium Citrate seems to work best for me, and I like being able to customize my own dosage. No fillers, and no artificial flavoring, excellent packaging, and a quality product.	I am not pleased with this product. I ordered this because it was the same ingredient in a similar product, 'CALM' magnesium citrate powder. However, this product is not what I expected. It does not taste or fizz like the CALM powder. This was an attempt to order in bulk and save money, but I failed with this one.	I like this product, but not sure how it's as strong as it says it is. I have noticed that I have better results from the Calms magnesium than taking double the dose of this product. I don't get the upset stomach from this like what's common for a citrate form, so maybe it's being absorbed better.	The BulkSupplements Pure Magnesium Citrate Powder dissolves easily in liquid and works especially great in my natural smoothies that I mix in a blender, and can also work great with juices. A much better deal than magnesium citrate in liquid solution form, especially the 1Kg bag.	Effective Magnesium supplement powder. Dissolves very easily in liquid. Extremely easy to use. Great for variable dosage amounts that are appropriate. Top quality product that is affordable. Top notch shipping and packaging.	This Magnesium Citrate Powder is high quality and it dissolves easily in liquids. The powder is a good value and it mixes well with other supplements or even in smoothies for daily use. The resealable bag makes for easy storage which makes it an ideal way to supplement with Magnesium.	Pure Magnesium Citrate Powder  seems to help improve overall health and well-being, and comes conveniently-packaged in bulk for a significant cost savings.  Unlike CALM powder, this Magnesium Citrate Powder is not effervescent, but dissolves in liquid nicely which makes it ideal for blending into smoothies or other beverages.	5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	1.0	4.0	5.0
health_personal_care	B004OQQLTU	Regretfully the package arrived in a plastic bag with a note on it telling us that the Post Office cares. The bottle had been completely crushed in bag it was sent in, so we never got to use it.The bag of liquid did smell great though!!!	I tried this on both a cotton t-shirt, and a polyester dress shirt, and it worked quite well, and very quick; almost effortless. Just spray it on, and smooth it with your fingers.The product says it can be used in the place of starch, but my wife tried it when ironing, and it didn't help at all.	i WOULD NOT RISK BUYING THIS ITEM. WAS DELIVERED TODAY. THE PACKAGE WAS COMPLETELY SOAKED AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN ANY SPRAY BOTTLE. I WILL BE ASKING FOR FULL REFUND.Amazon gave me a full credit when I chatted with them. I can't review since I didn't get any to try.	I really do not like to iron. I still have a scar from my last attempt. I love this product. I just spray onto my cotton shirt and smooth, then allow to dry about 30-60 minutes. There is an obvious reduction in wrinkles. No, it is not perfect, but it is presentable.	My wife and I tried this on a few items but it didn't work that great. I still have a lot of the bottle left so I'll keep on trying, but if we want it done right we still turn to the iron first. I do, however, really like how it takes away the static electricity buildup.	I love this stuff. It works on every types of clothing from jeans to tshirts and dress shirts. Spray a little on an work the wrinkle out with your hand! Just don't overspray. We take this on vacation so we don't have to waster our time ironing!	Woohoo what a great product. A few sprays and the wrinkles disappear from your teeshirts and dress shirts. It has a little trouble with clothing like dress pants and also it didn't work on removing wrinkles from my curtains. That said, this baby has saved me hours of ironing, and I'm super happy with this purchase.	This is a wonderful wrinkle release product. Just spray it on your fabric, any fabric smooth the product in with hands smoothing out wrinkles and let dry. Goodbye iron. I will definitely take it on my next vacation. It removes wrinkles and makes clothes smell fresh, I love it.	While it's not full proof, this spray is great at reducing the number of wrinkles in cotton and polyester materials. It's less effective on thicker materials. It's quick and easy to use, and it has a nice scent. It's a good thing to bring on vacation to freshen up packed clothes. Just be aware, the bottle is prone to leaking!	This spray works better than described. If used conservatively, wrinkles will come out of multiple kinds of fabric. This is a great alternative to ironing. The packaging will sometimes break in transit.	his wrinkle release product is great for anyone who hates to iron. Just spray on the fabric and smooth with fingers.  It seems to work better on some items than others: it is most successful with casual clothing like t-shirts and blue jeans. It also cuts down on static cling and smells great too!	3.0	4.0	1.0	4.0	3.0	5.0	4.0	5.0
home_kitchen	B0000CCY1S	I bought the Kiwi pro slicer, was cheaper and worked 100 times better then the OXO brand. Would not buy this brand again. When slicing it leaves all the sliced on the papaya and you can't contentiously keep slicing because it will fill up with papaya and stop slicing.	I am not excited about this peeler and wish I had found an easier tool. I have julienned my fingers using it - very sharp just like their other peelers which I have and love. It is difficult to use on carrots without injuring my fingers, maybe I just can't get the hang of it!	This is my 3rd purchase of julienne peelers the 1st 2 didn't work \u2026 waste of money. This one is the best ever! I have been making zucchini noodles and so many other things! Try this recipe I made! [...]	This julienne peeler works fantastic! I like the shield, I had to be very careful with my other on in the drawer to not get cut reaching for something. It is so much easier to handle with this grip and the blade stays in place. I would buy this product again.	This little guy performs really well and is comfortable to handle for long periods. The blade guard is a little weird in how it pivots, so it's kind of difficult to clean. My guard actually broke off, so I just left it off. The blades on this thing are quite sharp! So be careful if the same happens to you.	The Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler is a great gadget. I use it to Julienne zucchini and eggplant. Zucchini Julienned and sauteed quickly with EVOO, garlic powder, sea salt and fresh ground pepper is a terrific side dish. Even people who do not like zucchini will eat this.	It's easy to use and clean. It's a good price and does exactly what I wanted. I bought it to make julienne veggies carrots, zucchini noodles. It makes shorter pieces than a big fancy spiralizer, but that's good for me.	Strong and it works. I made zucchini noodles with this handy little device and now it looks like I'll be making this more often.Julienne the noodles and lightly salt them while the noodles are drying, make whatever sauce you are going to pour over them. The heat from the sauce should cook the noodles to a perfect al dente.	This Oxo Good Grips julienne peeler is a great buy for the experienced cook.  Zucchini lovers will enjoy this peeler. The blades are quite sharp and require cautious use, but peel vegetables beautifully.   Not very hard to clean and comes with a protective shield.	This julienne peeler works well and is comfortable to use. It is very sharp, so be careful when taking it out of its storage place. The blade guard can make the peeler awkward to clean and has been known to break off. It works particularly well on zucchini, but carrots are more difficult. The price is reasonable.	This julienne peeler is a quality gadget that works well. The blades are very sharp which makes the blade guard useful. It takes practice to use this tool and its blade guard. It creates great julienned veggie noodles with harder vegetables like carrots and zucchinis, but not with soft items like papayas.	2.0	2.0	5.0	5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0
home_kitchen	B0002U34HY	We've used these filters in our DustBuster for several years. With a little care, such as occasionally blowing it out with air or tapping on sidewalk, they have very long life. Seem to catch everything from grit, to dog hair, to fine ashes without letting much blow through exhaust. Getting harder to find at local stores, so I bought two.	This is the wrong filter if you are buying the CHV1510 Hand Vacuum. Amazon pairs it up together and it SAYS it works with all 'cyclonic hand vacs,' but it doesn't. You need the VF110 for the CHV1510. Amazon WRONG. Product Description WRONG. Me wrong for not reading the reviews first.	Instead of having to buy an all new Dustbuster just because mine is older and the filters aren't in stock anywhere didn't mean I had to updrage & pay for a newer one. After having found the filters here, I buy them and they work extremely well. Very satisfied.	I bought this to replace my tired and dirty filter. After I received it, I realized that there was nothing wrong with the one I already had. (They are washable.) However it helps to have two, so you can change the filter quickly when necessary and not take time to wash the first one.	This item list listed with the vacuum -- 'frequently bought together' with the Black & Decker CHV9608 9.6 Volt Cyclonic-Action Cordless DustBuster BUT this filter does NOT fit! Argh! Corrections are needed in the 'frequently bought together' section, and the correct filter needs to be listed.	I bought these filters because it said they are often bought with the vaccum I got. Recently, I went to put them in the vaccum and discovered they do not fit. To boot, I missed the window to get a refund. Rip off!	I bought the cordless Cyclonic DustBuster CHV1408. The correct filter for the DustBuster CHV1408 is Replacement Filter VF08. In the 'Frequently Bought Together' section at Amazon, both the VF100 replacement filter and the VF08 replacement filter are listed. The VF100 replacement filter WILL NOT fit the CHV1408.	I was disappointed to discover that the filter does not fit the Black and Decker Dustbuster I own. There are nubs around the top that prevent it from working. I have not been able by number or description to locate the proper filter or Amazon or anywhere else. This is very disappointing as I purchased the vacuum on Amazon.	Buying a new dustbuster is unnecessary when in reality just cleaning or replacing the filters will do the job just fine. Amazon also provides added risk by recommending dustbusters that don't fit with certain filters.	Filter works well at catching ashes and dog hair if it fits your model. Care should be taken to ensure this is the right filter for your vacuum as the retailer seems to be mismatching vacuum and filter recommendations. The filter is washable which will help with maintaining a long usable life.	This washable filter will not fit all cyclonic hand vacuums and extra caution needs be taken beforehand to ensure that the fit is correct. There are issues fitting this in to the Black and Decker Dustbuster. When it does actually fit it performs well, trapping dirt without letting much get through the vacuum exhaust.	5.0	1.0	5.0	5.0	1.0	1.0	2.0	1.0
home_kitchen	B000COQT0Y	I spent an hour looking for a solar system poster that included Pluto. My son insists it is unfair that Pluto was 'fired'. It includes information on conditions, atmosphere, diameter, and the duration of each planets 'day' and 'year'. It covered all the basic information we needed, and it is beautiful.	Pretty happy with the poster for something to teach my son when he grows up about just how small our world actually is compared to the other planets that are out there.Overall good quality and looks pretty good up on the wall.Big enough to catch someones eye and clear enough to tell which planet is which.	This poster is a few years out of date - still lists Pluto as a planet - but man, the artwork on it is awesome. I also love the inset map that shows the planets' sizes to scale. It's probably not good for a classroom due to its age, but for a bedroom or general decoration, it's great.	My son said 'Wow, this is great!' He's only 4 years but he's enjoying learning about the solar system. Each planet has an informative summary. Great service! Will be framing the poster for his room. Love it!!	Its a great poster! Bought at a huge discount. Only thing is I thought the description said laminated. It was not, its a standard poster. But its perfect for what I needed it for. Now I just have to get a frame for it: D	I could not have been more disappointed in my purchase! The picture and size was perfect but there were so many wrinkles it looked terrible. I took it to a professional framer and even using there equipment the wrinkles remained. When I bought the poster it was supposed to be brand new. I was really ripped off and may never order from Amazon again.	It's a bit dated, and if your not sitting directly by it, it's a bit hard to read. The poster is nice though. We didn't get a frame just hung it on the wall for homeschooling, we like it a lot!	The item arrived on time and my son loves it. It's posted on the side wall next to his bed. He looks at it all the time. The picture quality is not perfect but for the price it's okay.	This poster is large and colorful. However, the quality is poor and the information is outdated. It will grab someone's attention, but maybe not worth the money.	This solar system poster is out of date and the information no longer holds true. As an educational poster, it falls short, but as an artwork, it's quite nice. The poster lists Pluto still with its planetary status intact which is no longer the case. It's a plain poster and needs to be framed to if it's to be used as art.  If this poster is needed for its aesthetic qualities, it's recommended, but if it's needed as a teaching tool, it is not recommended.	The poster is a little outdated because it still lists Pluto as a planet, but it is a beautiful poster. There are some concerns regarding the quality of the shipping as there was the issue of it not being laminated and also having wrinkles.	5.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	1.0	3.0	4.0
home_kitchen	B006Y401K0	I just redid my kitchen all in purple. This is a great color and it is really big. I bought two of them and I am so happy, it holds a lot of utensils. And very pretty too. It is sturdy, not cheap junk.	I was having such a hard time finding a large enough utensil crock, that of course also matched my d\u00e9cor. I have the chunky orange utensil set from Rachael Ray & definitely needed something this size. It's perfect & beautiful. Love it!	This utensil crock met all my expectations! I love the color and it holds quite a few kitchen tools! I'm glad I DIDN 'T go with the 1qt. size! Great size, fits easily in a corner on my countertop! If you need a handy storage containter and want it to look great on your counter top this is what you want!	For some reason the crock shows to be taller and slimmer in THIS COLOR, but it's not. It's the wider and slightly shorter one I wanted. It's very pretty. Plenty room for everything, including the utinsils with the larger rubber handles.	This crock is very large and gives you plenty of room for utensils (especially now that many utensils have the thick rubber handles). I was able to condense from 2 drawers to 1 now that I have this crock on the counter. Seems very high quality and looks beautiful.	Tired of fighting to get my cooking utensils out of another type of vessel Le Creuset proves once again to be my top choice in the kitchen. This crock gives plenty of space for over a dozen everyday utensils, looks perfect on the counter and is not too large getting in the way of work space. The white color is classic for any decor.	I LOVE this utensil crock! Le Creuset has never let me down and the color is just fabulous. By being larger than expected, I was delighted to find that ALL my cooking tools fit, with room to spare. Its a perfect addition to my kitchen, and its a magnificent color.	I love the color and it fits in with other pieces that I have. It is a good size for holding items. It is a slightly different shape than the one I already had so it makes a nice contrast sitting on the counter top.	This product is a great addition to any kitchen! The color is fantastic and it's sturdy build is perfect for holding as many kitchen utensils as it does! It holds a lot of utensils without being too big and bulky so it fits nicely on the kitchen cabinet. Definitely would recommend for any kitchen!	This Le Creuset crock is sizable, able to hold over a dozen utensils, including ones with thick rubber handles. It will save drawer space, and be an attractive addition to any kitchen.	This crock is large enough to hold many utensils, but isn't too large to take up valuable space on a counter. The colors are appealing, and it is very high quality. Even utensil sets with large rubber handles can all fit into this holder. It is highly recommended.	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0
home_kitchen	B006CO18RM	It is a great vacuum, it work very nicely but... The electric hose is heavier than he non electric one and significantly heavier. My arm gets tired more quickly. I got a canister to avoid having a heavy weight on my arm, but his one is heavier than expected.	My first Miele vacuum... great to use on hardwood floors, tile and area rugs. Could be better for wall to wall carpeting but there are more expensive Miele vacuums for that purpose. Like that it has special filters to remove allergens from air and love that it is so lightweight.	Too bad there isn't a way to rate this higher 'cause I would. Very quite. A little pricey, but you get a quality product for your money. Wife likes it, and has vacuumed more than she used to with the old vacuum it's so much easier to use. And did I mention quiet?	I moved from a house that had a cental vacuum system. I was concerned about how happy I would be with a separate vacuum cleaner (not central system). I love my new Miele vacuum cleaner! It is stronger than my central vacuum for me! Pathetic canister moves with ease and the retractable ford is great. Love this system!!!!	From the get go, this vacuum is a keeper. It is super quiet yet has the suction power of a shop-vac. The vacuum is simple to use and lightweight. Our only issue was that the box was very damaged upon receipt, but there is no apparent damage to the machine. Concerning that it would even be shipped due to the box damage.	It really sucks. What do I mean. Well, first, it really does a great job of sucking up dirt, always a good ability for a vacuum cleaner. It also sucks because the replacement bags are pricey and need to be changed out every other month in our cat and child-filled household.	Very high quality vacuum. Read the reviews before you buy. The old reliable names are no longer the same quality. Miele is one of the best. You get what you pay for. Thanks Amazon for making my choices easier to research and purchase.	I can't believe we went so long without the Miele! For years we fell for the Dyson gimmicks and I honestly feel stupid about the amount of money we have thrown at them after a few months with the Miele. It is so quiet and super light and unlike the Dyson it will actually do carpets!	The lightweight, quiet and easy to use Miele vacuum is a great and favorable against other competitors Vacuum's such as Dyson. The Miele has filters that help with eliminating allergens from the air. One thing regarding the bag replacements is that they can be a little pricey. Overall the Miele vacuum is recommended.	This vacuum is a great vacuum that is very high quality. It has a very high powered suction system and tends to be very quiet. It is simple to use and lightweight, though it does tend to be a bit expensive. Miele is a brand that is now moving up in the ranks among vacuum cleaners.	This Miele vacuum is wonderful at sucking up dirt.  It is quiet, and easy to use.  The price is a bit higher than other vacuums on the market but the quality of the product is reflected in its price.  This is a bagged vacuum, so there is an added expense of the bags to be factored in.	4.0	4.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0	5.0
home_kitchen	B006NNLX2C	Not sure I really like this. Because it's made of silicone, it's very flexible. That means it spills easily. It's also quite small, as other reviewers have pointed out. It's good for making small portions for one or two people.	The item cooks a small serving of vegetables okay but its so floppy to hold onto that I won't buy anymore silicone cookwear / bakewear. My microwave is up over the stove and its too hard to hold onto a floppy item when taking it out and its hot.	I have used this steamer every day since I have gotten it. It steams zucchini perfect in as little as 2 minutes. It makes perfect steamed cauliflower in 3 minutes. I will never tire of how fast it makes my vegetables and the ease of clean up time!!	I love this steamer and am purchasing a second one! It's a great size for a single person to steam veggies or even microwave fish, and the silicone makes it so easy to clean and store. The apple green color is cheerful and I love I can eat from the container (I hate doing dishes LOL).	I liked this steamer when I got it, but it has gotten to be a very unstable item to try and use. I hate taking it out of microwave when hot because I am afraid of it dumping hot food all over me.	I'm glad I tried this steamer. It is so easy to use and the veggie and fish tasted so much better! I think this will help me to stick to my weight loss goal by keeping me full eating more veggies.	As previously reviewed, this steamer is not overly sized. Perfect for single servings / possibly two. Easy to clean. I have a steam setting on my microwave that protests that the lid doesn't fit snuggly enough. Again, you get what you pay for.	I use it all the time for my veggies. It steams my broccoli or green beans in 2.5-3 mins and they are perfect. The container is flimsy and can be hot out of microwave, but rinses off easily and is rest to go again.	This is a perfect steamer for single servings! However, it is flimsy and has the potential to spill everywhere, not to mention the chance for burns. The color of the steamer is very appealing and it is easy to clean. Definitely, worth the money for steaming smaller portions of food.	This steamer is the right size to steam one or two portions of vegetables or other food. It is made of silicone, which makes it easy to clean, but also flimsy, so care should be taken when removing it from the microwave. Overall, its positives outweigh the negatives, and it is recommended.	This silicone steamer is great for making portions for one or two people. It steams vegetables in minutes with a simple quick clean up and the silicone steamer is easy to store. However, because it's silicone, it's flexible which means it tends to get floppy when hot out of the microwave.	3.0	3.0	5.0	5.0	3.0	5.0	3.0	5.0
home_kitchen	B004R9X6VU	Not much air comes out of this thing. What does come out only comes out one side so I can't have it oscillate. I have to turn it so the side that has the air coming out is facing me.Piece of crap..... don't waste your money! Perfect example of 'you get what you pay for'. >: (	This fan takes up very little space and is pretty quiet. Since it's fairly tall, it can blow in your face when you're sitting down. It would be nice to be able to change the degree of oscillation, but that's not a huge deal.	I've had this for two months now, and I've noticed that it feels like there's only air coming out of one side. Bummer. Not sure what could be the problem, but it's too late to return it. Wouldn't recommend.	It's not that powerful unless you are all of a few inches from it. It wobbles a bit and after a few weeks of use it starts to squeak if you use the oscillating setting. I wish I wouldn't have cheaped out and bought a better more expensive fan.	This fan is pretty noisy in my sons small bedroom but I only really put it on the lowest setting so it's no big deal. What bothers me about it is that the fan blows out to the side of the vents rather than in the middle so I have to really play with it to aim it properly.	This fan is a horrible purchase. It doesn't blow air straight ahead. You have to turn the fan at an angle to feel any wind AND only if on high and within 24 inches. It was such a waste of money, I now have to buy another fan.	This tower fan is the right size, the right color. But the air flows from the side of the vent not from the full vent. You have to turn the fan almost to the wall to get the benefit of the fan. I would not recommend this fan.	My fan arrived with an out of balance blade assembly and had to be returned. The base is too small, which lets the tower sway. I ordered the Holmes HTF3211AR-BU and for a few extra dollars got a fan with a bigger base and remote control. Much better quality.	There's some issues with the fan, including air only coming out of one side and not straight ahead, which requires creative handling to mitigate. It's also small and not very powerful, and makes some noise. However, it does have a small form and takes up little space, and is tall enough to reach upper parts of the body while sitting.	The air flow from this fan is weak even on a high setting and air only flows out of the side of the machine rather than the vents, making the oscillation feature useless. The fan has a low price tag but is not worth the cost. This fan is not recommended even at a low price.	This fan is a good size and quiet but it doesn't blow air well. It blows air from the side vent and not the front vent which makes the oscillation function less useful. The only solution is turning the fan towards the wall. Overall, this is not a quality fan and it's not recommended.	1.0	4.0	2.0	3.0	3.0	1.0	2.0	1.0
