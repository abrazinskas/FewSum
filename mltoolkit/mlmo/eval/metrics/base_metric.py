    Parent metrics class, where metrics are used to calculate different
    evaluation scores on data batches or single units. For example, accuracy or
    exact matches.

    Each metric is calculated in the on-line fashion. Where predicted and true
    labels are fed iteratively to the 'accum' method that usually returns
    temporary results, and stores statistics for later aggregation.

    For example, for accuracy metric, we might aggregate the number of correct
    predictions, and the total number of labels. Later, we aggregate those
    statistics to compute the final accuracy score.
