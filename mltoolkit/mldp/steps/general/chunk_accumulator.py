    """
    ChunkAccumulator step allows to group or change the size of data-chunks that
    are passed along the pipeline. The step does not alter the format of
    data-chunks only their size.

    For example, one might want to use larger chunks (e.g. size of 500) for
    computational purposes (fast vectorized operations on large numpy arrays)
    but to train a model on smaller data-chunks (e.g. size of 64). In that case,
    the step should be added after all computationally intensive ones.
    It works both by accumulating smaller upstream data-chunks and passing
    larger data-chunks downstream, and splitting larger upstream data-chunks
    into smaller downstream data-chunks.

    The adjuster uses chunk collectors, which have different notions of size.
    For example, UnitCollector works as described above. However, a
    more exotic collector can accumulate data-units which have the same 'id'
    field's value. And output a new chunk only after a sufficient number of
    unique ids is collected.
